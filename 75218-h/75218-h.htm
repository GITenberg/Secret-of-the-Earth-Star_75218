<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>The theft of the Earth Star blazed a trail
of death to a weird city under the Sahara.</span></p>
</div>

<div><h1>CHAPTER I</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Despite the blazing heat of the
hot Indian night, this air-conditioned
room in the palace was
cool and comfortable. It was a bit too
luxurious for a business office; otherwise,
it might have been any New York
suite. Three men sat at a small glass-topped
table, on which stood a Gladstone
bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rose as two Indians entered,
bowing respectfully to the Rajah. The
latter was a small, weak-faced man with
a straggling moustache and lips too
large and red for his sallow face. He
barely acknowledged the greetings, his
gaze riveted on the leather bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have the Earth Star?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said one of the three Europeans.
He opened the bag, unlocked a
metal case built into it, and withdrew
a jewel-case. This he opened and placed
flat on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rajah’s mouth went dry. He
could not repress a little shiver. “The
Earth Star .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On black velvet the great gem flamed.
It was lens-shaped and supernally lovely,
with rays of living light flaming out
from its heart. The colors latent within
it changed and shifted under the soft
illumination. It was like a diamond—yet
no diamond had ever possessed the
wonder of the Earth Star.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rajah’s secretary breathed deeply.
“Carbon,” he murmured. “A tree-fern
some million years ago—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the Europeans interrupted,
though he did not look away from the
jewel. “A little more than that, sir. It
took unusual pressure to make the Earth
Star. It came from the new cavern
mines under the Atlantic, you know,
when they were taking cores to test
from immense depths. A tree-fern made
the Earth Star—but that fern was
somehow buried deeper than man has
ever thought possible. It’s immensely
harder than diamond, though it’s carbon,
of course. And the only one in existence—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rajah said softly, “There is an
Earth Star in the crown of your ruler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A subdued smile went the rounds of
the group. “So there is, and an excellent
imitation, too. I repeat: you will
be the owner of the only Earth Star in
existence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rajah placed his slim hand, glittering
with invaluable jeweled rings, flat
on the table-top. “Then it is a bargain.
My secretary will give you a
check.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly the moonlight was blotted
out. The figure of a man seemed to
rush out of the night, leaping in through
the open window to land lightly on the
deep carpet. And that window overlooked
a sheer abyss, reaching down to
the river gorge far below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sudden movements of the Europeans,
and the quick gesture of the Rajah’s
secretary, were arrested at sight
of an oddly shaped pistol in a gloved
hand. The intruder stood motionless,
one hand gripping a light metal ladder
that extended up through the window
and out of sight. He wore ordinary flying
togs, but his face was hidden by
a black silk mask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t move,” he said, in a low voice
that was obviously disguised. “No—don’t
do that!” The pistol jerked
slightly; otherwise there was no indication
that the trigger had been pulled.
But one of the Europeans cursed softly
as his arm dropped to his side, paralyzed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A neurogun,” the masked man observed
pleasantly. “It <span class='it'>can</span> kill, you
know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll thank you not to move.
Now—” He hooked the flexible ladder
across a chair and moved warily to the
table. “The Earth Star, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a fool,” the secretary said.
“You can’t hope to sell that. It’s
unique.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intruder did not answer, but his
quizzical gaze was amused. The tallest
of the Europeans snarled, “Sell it?
Jackass—haven’t you ever heard of the
Merlin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, his foot moved slightly
toward the chair to which the ladder
was attached. He froze as the Merlin
turned toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You recognize me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” The Merlin’s voice was
suddenly sharp. “Then listen! I have
ways of finding out what I want to
know. I discovered that certain powers
ruling your country had decided to sell
the Earth Star to our friend the Rajah.
The price I don’t know, but it must be
fabulous. If that money were to go to
needed purposes, I’d not have come here
tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tall European kicked the chair
gently. The metal ladder slipped off,
slid across the carpet, and vanished out
the window. The Merlin apparently did
not notice, though his retreat was now
cut off.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>He went on: “But the money is to
be used for armaments. And you
gentlemen, and those behind you, are
trying to foment a new war. As for
you—” He glanced at the Rajah. “You
are a degenerate moron. <span class='it'>Don’t move!</span>
It’s probably the first time you’ve ever
heard the truth, but you’re going to hear
it now. You’re the wealthiest man in
the Orient, and you inherited your fortune,
as well as your powers. You won’t
buy the Earth Star out of your own
treasury, though. It’ll mean taxes for
your people, who are starving already.
Another reason why I’m here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Merlin glanced down. “This bit
of carbon is causing trouble, I think.
So I’ll take it along. The imitation that
was made to replace it won’t interest the
Rajah. So—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slipped the jewel in his pocket and
moved back toward the window. The
others watched him narrowly. The Merlin
apparently did not notice the absence
of his metal ladder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gun was still steady in one hand,
but in the other he now held an object
like a small flashlight. “You may be
interested in knowing how I evaded
your guards and alarms. I came in a
gyroship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—my motor-killing rays—” The
Rajah’s eyes were wide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They extend up only 300 feet. I
hovered well above that point and came
down a ladder. And here it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ladder swung in from the darkness.
The Merlin’s voice was amused
as he slipped the “flashlight” into his
flying suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A clever trick—but I have a very
powerful magnet. I’ll leave you, gentlemen—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant his attention was distracted
as he put one foot on the window-sill.
Simultaneously the tallest
European acted. With a deep-voiced
oath he sprang forward, seized the Merlin,
and clamped one hand over the outlaw’s
gun-wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold him!” the secretary shrilled.
He dived for an alarm buzzer. The
other Europeans closed in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Merlin fought in silence. His
opponent was trying to drag him back
into the room—and that would be fatal.
The outlaw dropped his weapon and
gripped the ladder, with both hands
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pulled himself up, putting all his
weight on his arms. Inevitably the
European was lifted too. Overbalanced,
the two went arcing into the night as
clutching fingers missed their mark by
a fraction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoot!” the Rajah screamed. “Shoot
him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Guns blazed from the window. Dim
in the moonlight two figures were struggling
on a frail metal ladder, suspended
above nothingness. A scrap of cloth
went fluttering down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His mask—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the dark came a voice, sharp
and clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Martell!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It rose in a scream. One of the figures
went plunging down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The secretary was at the window, a
flashlight in his hand. He focused the
beam on the quarry, a man in flying togs
who kept his face turned from the light.
Now other rays shot out from the roof,
bathing the Merlin in merciless brilliance.
A shot cracked sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll get him,” the Rajah said.
“I’ve sub-machine guns on the roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Merlin’s hand lifted, fumbled
over the ladder. And—suddenly—he
was gone! Ladder and outlaw vanished!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rajah stared in blank amazement.
“How—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Automatic winding device in his
plane. It just wound him up.” The
European who spoke looked at his
empty gun. “Better get your planes
after him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a nod from the Rajah the secretary
hurried from the room. “We’ll
get him,” royalty remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you won’t. The Merlin’s got
a fast plane. He’s pulled off these things
before. But this time—well, he lost
his mask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you recognize him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stone did, before he fell. He
screamed a name. Remember? Martell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A common name,” the Rajah
frowned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stone and I worked closely together.
He knew no Martells. He recognized
the name and the face from elsewhere.
Newsreels—newspapers—everybody
knows Seth Martell and his sons. I’ll
get in touch with my government immediately.
May I use your televisor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Recover the Earth Star, and
I’ll buy it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said the European grimly,
“is a bargain.”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Escape</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Seth Martell’s craggy, strong
face was set in harsh lines as he sat
staring at a folded paper on his desk.
Sunlight came warmly through the windows
of the penthouse apartment above
New York, silvering Martell’s iron-gray
hair and clipped moustache. He looked
hard as nails—till he lifted his lids and
gazed at the three young men before
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seth Martell was one of the biggest
men in America. Connected with the
military, high up in the government, his
honesty had never been questioned, nor
his devotion to his country. Always he
had been unswerving in serving his own
ideals, no matter what self-sacrifice it
entailed. Now—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now there was pain in his gray eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at his three sons and hesitated,
tapping the folded document
with stubby, calloused fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of the three spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martell reached for a buzzer, and
then drew back his hand. He looked at
the tallest of the three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tony. Are you the Merlin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony—a dark, lean young man, with
very keen black eyes and a thin eager
face—cocked up a quizzical eyebrow.
“I, sir? The—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martell’s restraint failed for an instant
as he snapped, “Answer me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony sobered. “No, sir,” he said
quietly. “I’m not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second youth, blond and stocky,
took a stubby pipe out of his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimmy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third of the trio looked somewhat
like Tony, though a less matured
man. The eagerness in Tony’s face was
enthusiasm in Jimmy’s, boyish and
pleasant. He shot a quick glance at the
others, hesitated, and finally said, with
a little frown, “I’m not the Merlin, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Martell sighed. “All right. Go in the
sun-room and wait, boys. The investigators
will be in presently.” He sat
steadily regarding his nails till his sons
had departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony left them at the door. “Be with
you directly,” he murmured, and hurried
off along the corridor. The others
went into the room, and ten minutes
later the oldest of the three came in, his
face blandly impassive. He went to the
window and stood staring out over the
skyscrapers of New York, waiting on
the verge of the 21st century. He began
to whistle ruminatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seth insisted on interviewing us before
the detecs. Good of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Jimmy, nervously lighting a
cigarette, nodded. “Damn good. But
all this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil’s serious eyes were questioning.
“Are you sure? There’s no doubt the
authorities think one of us is a crook.
I wonder—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a little silence. Finally
Jimmy asked, “Who is this Merlin, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cleverest crook in the world,” said
Tony, turning. “At least, he’s been
kicking around for two years. That
means a lot these days. He’s pretty
much of a Robin Hood. Only kills in
self-defense—and never for personal
profit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil broke in, “Plenty of criminals
have evaded capture for years, but
they’re the small fry. Not important
enough to attract attention. But the
Merlin—everyone thinks he’s had years
of experience. Remember when Janison
died? The governor? The Merlin
killed him, and nobody knew why
till they found out Janison was one of
the biggest political racketeers in the
country. He’s a Robin Hood of sorts,
but the law won’t stand for Robin
Hoods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And,” said Tony sardonically, “one
of us is the Merlin. So they say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil grinned. “Which one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they’ll find out. They’ll chart
our psychology—our character patterns—and
check it with the analysis of the
Merlin’s activities. Their lie-detectors
will tell them which one of us is the
Merlin. That’s positive identification,
you know.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy crushed out his cigarette,
lips working. He swung suddenly
on the others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re damn flippant about it!
What if it’s true? What if one of us
<span class='it'>is</span> this crook—d’you know what that’ll
mean to Seth? His son shown to the
world as a thief and a murderer. Seth
will stick by us; I know that. But I
know what his honor means to him. He
got that silver plate in his skull because
he thought more of honor than his life.
And now—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up, Jimmy,” Phil said quietly.
“We know all that. But what can we
do about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony murmured, “Our youngest
brother is about to suggest that the
Merlin confess. A touching sentiment.
Headlines all over the world announcing
the news. Seth resigning all his
offices immediately—he’d do that.
Everyone knowing that a son of Seth
Martell was—the Merlin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil said, “The Merlin might .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
disappear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’d have to disappear for good.
Suppose I’m the lad, Philip, and suppose
I disappear. A signed confession
would be just as effective. The moment
I disappear, it proves I’m the Merlin.
No one has ever watched us. As Seth’s
sons, we’re above the routine character-checks.
We reported to Seth once a
month. Otherwise we were free, all of
us, with plenty of time to do as we
pleased. Including brigandage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil grunted. “Anyway, people can’t
simply drop out of sight in this day and
age. Not with television, specialized
wireless, telephotography, and so forth.
Where the devil could a man hide for
years?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the Foreign Legion,” Tony said,
and waited. His gaze searched the faces
of the other two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surprise, astonishment, and incredulity
showed. And vanished. Into Phil’s
eyes came a look of dogged grimness.
And Jimmy’s face showed—excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Legion?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah. No extradition. Since 1960,
when the company started. No government
has a hand in the Legion. They
rent its services from the company, just
as the Hessian dukes used to sell their
soldiers to fight for other countries.
When there’s a job to be done too dirty
for anyone else, they ask the Legion—and
waive extradition. The Polar fortresses.
The Sub-Sahara. The Canal
Patrols on Mars. Dangerous space-lane
patrols. It isn’t like the ancient French
Legion. This one’s privately owned,
and, once you get in, nothing on Earth
or Mars can touch you. As long as
you’re in the Legion. Men don’t live
long in it, as a rule.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cheerful thought,” Phil grunted,
puffing at his pipe. “By the way, which
of us <span class='it'>is</span> the Merlin?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony smiled. “I’m the guy, lads.
And that’s what I’ve been building up
to. I’m going to drop out of sight.
Head for the Legion. And—well, I
wanted you two to know about it. I
can’t tell Seth, of course. But—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be damned,” Phil said in blank
amazement. “You’ve got the Earth
Star?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Odd. I happen to have it myself. In
a hollow tooth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re both crazy,” said Jimmy.
“I’ve got it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony shook his head. “It’s no use.
There’s no point in the three of us going
into the Legion. One’s enough.
So—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil said, “Wait a minute. Suppose
all three of us disappear? Nobody’d
press a charge against three men, when
obviously two were innocent. I happen
to have the jewel myself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah,” Tony grunted. “But slow
down. You’re both going off the deep-end.
I’m leaving now. Heading for the
Legion, and you’re both staying here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy said, “We’ll meet you there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The argument kept on—with no result.
Jimmy and Phil were adamant.
Each one insisted he had the stolen gem.
And, if they didn’t accompany Tony,
they’d simply go after him on their own
hook. “So we’d better stick together,”
Phil said at last. “We’ll have a better
chance that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s lips were compressed. “You
crazy fools! You’d do it, too .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well,
stay here. I’m going after an amphiplane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if the investigators get here
first?” Phil asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stall ’em. And keep your eye on
that window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy was chewing his lip. “How
do you expect to get out? If there are
guards—”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s grin flashed. “You’ll find
out.” He turned to the door—and
was gone, apparently unruffled. But as
he hurried along the passage there was
a gnawing uneasiness in his mind.
Guards would no doubt be watching to
prevent just such an attempt at escape
as this. Only blind luck could help now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went into the big, gleaming
kitchen, a bare room with murals on its
walls. Every appliance had been built-in,
so that stove, tables, and so forth,
could be swung out from their cubbyholes
by the pressure of a button. The
room was empty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s sharp eyes flickered about,
resting at last on a panel near by. He
went to it, swung it open, and revealed
a black hole beyond. The dumbwaiter.
A glance upward informed him that the
little car was below, though how far he
did not know. Deftly Tony swung his
legs through the hole and seized the
ropes in strong fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He closed the panel behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It wasn’t entirely dark. A diffused
pale glow filtered down from above, and
gently, carefully, Tony let himself slip
toward the shaft’s bottom. It was a
long chance. Unless he found footing
on the dumbwaiter car soon, his fingers
would inevitably lose their cramped
grip. For this was a penthouse apartment
in a skyscraper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down he went into the shaft. Skin
scraped from his hands. It grew
darker, and below him was only unfathomable
blackness. Tony hooked
his legs about the rope and rested for
a few moments, though he dared not
delay long. Time was vitally important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then down he went again. He was in
pitch darkness now, every muscle
strained and beginning to ache. His
hands stung painfully. His shoulders
were throbbing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s feet thumped softly upon the
peaked top of the car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gasping with relief, he relaxed, keeping
the ropes wound about his wrist so
that his weight would not carry the car
to the bottom too suddenly. But a moment
later he was plummeting down,
occasionally checking his speed when
caution grew stronger than the imperative
need for haste. Up in the penthouse
Jimmy and Phil were waiting,
perhaps being questioned even now by
the investigators. And Seth—unseen in
the darkness, Tony’s face grew grim.
Seth was suffering. The old man’s devotion
to his ideals, to humanity was
pitted against his genuine love for his
three step-sons. And one of those three
was the Merlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally the car thumped against the
bottom of the shaft. A little crack of
light indicated the panel opening into
the porter’s cellar. Tony used his
knife-blade to open it, easing the door
outward little by little till he discovered
that the room was vacant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest was surprisingly easy. A
pair of overalls and a cap in a closet
made a satisfactory disguise, and, carrying
a can of rubbish, Tony walked
blandly past the service man posted on
guard outside. He deposited his burden
on the sidewalk, and without a
pause began to hurry toward the corner.
A hail stopped him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, there! Wait a minute!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony turned. The guard was following
him, gaze probing. A thick finger
thrust out suspiciously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’re you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The street was almost empty. Tony
didn’t wait for the guard. He hastened
toward him, arms hanging loosely at his
side—until the last moment. Then, as
recognition came into the man’s eyes
and as his hand dived into a pocket,
Tony brought up his fist in a vicious
uppercut. The blow was delivered at
such close quarters that it went unobserved
by passers-by. The dull
thwack of bone against bone was the
only sound. Tony caught the guard
as he fell, pulled him swiftly back into
the cellar, and left him there. The man
was out for the count.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>There were no other guards.
Tony’s progress was not halted
again. He reached his destination, secured
a small, swift amphiplane,
equipped with gyros, and lifted it
through the port in the roof. Luckily,
he had plenty of money in his pocket—enough
to buy the plane instead of renting
it, had he desired to do so. But,
like most ships of this type, the instrument
board was fitted with a “homing
pigeon” device, by which the plane
could be set to return to its garage along
a radio beam whenever desired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s fingers flickered over the controls.
The ship was a honey—small and
swift, built like a thick cigar, with retractable
wings and props. He swung
up in a wide arc that presently brought
him directly over the penthouse that
was his goal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Briefly he wondered what had happened
there, and whether Phil and Jimmy
were still waiting. Well—fast work
was vital now. The investigators were
already on guard. Sight of an approaching
plane would warn them of trouble.
Tony checked his controls, took a few
deep breaths—and dropped faster than
was safe. The wind shrieked up into a
high-pitched whine past the ship, almost
beyond the threshold of hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The skyscraper leaped toward him
like a driving lance. Its top seemed
about to impale him. But the controls
had been expertly set, and the craft fled
down safely to one side, stopping with
a bone-wrenching jolt as the automatics
took hold. Tony fought back giddiness
and stared out through swimming
eyes. His blurred vision focused. Too
far to the left—</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slid the ship forward. This was
the window. Inside, he could see Phil’s
broad back, and one hand extended in
a sign of warning. So the investigators
had already arrived. But where was
Jimmy? Tony couldn’t be sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice he didn’t recognize was talking.
One of the investigators .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we’ll find him. And the lie-detectors
will give us the information
we want. Trying to frame Seth Martell
is the dirtiest thing the Merlin ever
did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy said, “You’re nuts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah? One of our men saw it. The
Merlin was opening Martell’s safe—trying
to put the Earth Star in it and
throw the blame on Martell. But he
didn’t have time. Our man was too
close, and the Merlin had to scram in
a hurry. Now—which one of you was
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s eyebrows lifted. A new element
had entered into the affair. Trying
to throw the blame on Seth—yeah,
that <span class='it'>was</span> a hell of a lousy trick. So—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony whistled softly, and saw Phil
jerk aside, crying out something. A
slim form came hurtling toward the window.
Tony got a glimpse of Jimmy’s
pale young face; then the boy was hurtling
out into space, almost overshooting
the mark in his eagerness. Tony
seized his arm and pulled him back as
he swayed on the ship’s edge. The craft
dipped slightly under the additional
weight, and then lifted again as compensatory
stabilizers went into action.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>From within the room came a crash,
and a sharp cry of pain. Phil appeared,
his face stolid and expressionless.
He jumped, landing accurately,
and immediately whirled. In his hand,
Tony saw, was a bronze figurine he had
snatched up from a table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run for it!” he snapped. There
were faces in the window. A gun
snarled viciously. Phil hurled the figurine
with deadly aim, shattering the
glass above the group, and the investigators
dodged back as shards and splinters
showered them. Almost immediately
they were back—but Tony’s
hands had found the controls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship fled up. As it fled it curved
southward, till far below could be seen
the shining waters of Long Island
Sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy said tautly, “They’re coming
after us. I can see planes—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil touched a lever. The upper
framework of the plane was instantly
sheathed with transparent walls, making
it more than ever resemble a fat,
shining cigar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony sent the craft rocketing down.
Almost at the surface of the water, he
pulled out into a glide, swooping almost
without a splash into the Sound. The
light was blotted out by green translucence
that grew darker as the ship
slanted into the depths.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not too deep,” Phil suggested. “The
hull won’t stand a crack-up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony didn’t answer. He was fingering
the controls, trying to get every possible
bit of speed out of the ship before
the pursuers located it with their search-rays.
If they could reach the outer Atlantic,
they’d be safe—barring accident.
But they were not safe in the Sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly the water ahead sizzled and
bubbled with heat. An aerial torpedo
had been launched. Tony shot up and
then almost immediately dived again,
shifting sharply to the left. Before
his companions could get their breath,
the ship was rushing back along the
way it had came, retracing its path.
Jimmy said sharply, “What the hell—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil’s fingers dug into the youngster’s
arm. “Good idea, Tony.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The latter nodded. “Maybe. We’ll
dig in at the mouth of the Hudson.
They’ll never look for us there. Then
tonight we can slip out, take the air
again—and head for the Company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy said, “Once we’re there, we’re
safe. There’s no extradition from the
Legion, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only to Hell,” Tony remarked,
grinning.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Legion of the Lost</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>“So,” said the fat little man with
the shaved head, “so you want to
join the Legion. Eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony looked him over. The dingy
office in the outskirts of the North
African city was unimpressive. But,
somehow, the little man was not. He
wore dirty white tropical linens, his face
glistened with sweat, but to the three
brothers he represented fate. On his
decision their destiny would depend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah,” Tony said. “We want to
join. Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man smiled, tapping pudgy
fingers on the crowded desk. “Well.
Let’s see. You passed the physical examination.
Your names are—Anthony.
Phillips. Jameson.” The pale blue
eyes sparkled maliciously. “Better remember
’em. Sometimes it’s hard at
first, but you’ll get used to them. I’m
sure I don’t know why everyone who
enters the Legion changes his name.
There’s no extradition. However .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You are joining for a term of five years.
If you wish to leave before then, you
can buy your freedom if you have the
money. If you have not, you must
serve your term.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may try to escape. You may
succeed. You may fail, and in that case
will be assigned to the guards in the
uranium pits of Mars. No one has ever
escaped from there. It is not advisable—”
The blue eyes were hard as steel
now. “It is scarcely wise to attempt
escape. Aside from all else, when you
leave us, you are no longer under the
Company’s protection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed a plump hand over his
shining head. “Anything more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony glanced at his brothers and
shook his head. “Not a thing. What
happens next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Sub-Sahara post needs men.
It’s an easy job for recruits, keeping
the Copts in check and seeing they
don’t go outside raiding. Here!” A
buzzer rang, and soon a man entered,
clad in the dull gray uniform of the
Legion. He saluted casually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Brady,” said the fat little
man, “these three are assigned to Sub-Sahara.
Rookies. Anthony, Phillips,
Jameson. Break ’em in.” He immediately
became engrossed in the papers
piled high on his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony looked at the officer with interest.
He saw a spare figure, and a
worn, tired face, deeply lined, with
sunken eyes and a clipped moustache.
An adventurer gone to seed, he thought—grown
tired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady said, “Come along,” and led
the way out of the room. They emerged
in blazing white sunlight. A helicopter
stood a few rods away, and the captain
gestured toward it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>’ntre.</span> We’ll fly, and talk as we go.
Discipline needn’t begin till we reach
Sub-Sahara, so if you’ve any questions—I’m
at your service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed toward the plane, and
followed the brothers into it. With
quick, familiar motions he lifted the
craft into the air and sent it winging
southward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll stop at Azouad. That’s an oasis
on the way. You can get smokes and
equipment there—personal stuff you
may want. That is—if you have any
money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s eyes narrowed, but he merely
said, “We’ve a little.” He shifted on
the worn leather seat, glancing aside at
Captain Brady. The man’s haggard
face was immobile, the eyes mere slits
as he squinted into the flaming sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the rear of the plane came Jimmy’s
voice. “Just what is Sub-Sahara?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Brady’s voice went dull with routine.
“Well—twenty years or more
ago a labyrinth of caverns was discovered
under the Sahara. It was inhabited
by survivors of prehistoric Egyptians—Copts.
They were trapped underground
in some ancient catastrophe,
and got along there, gradually growing
accustomed to their environment. Matter
of fact—there was a sort of colony
in the old pre-dynastic days down there.
The Copts worked mines, and there was
a—well, a city of miners under the Sahara.
When the entrance was blocked,
the miners couldn’t get out—so they
stayed there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about food?” Jimmy asked.
“And oxygen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a lot about that Copt tribe
we don’t know. Food—well, fish and
mushrooms are staples. The Midnight
Sea lies under the Sahara. Ages ago
the water in it made the desert itself a
sea, but it drained underground at last.
As for oxygen, there must have been
outlets before we blasted some, though
they’ve never been discovered. Possibly
through river caves that drain into
the sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Brady rubbed his eyes with
the back of one mahogany hand. “A lot
we don’t know about the Copts. Savage,
ferocious—but marvelous miners.
The Legion’s posted there to keep order.
Prevent raids on the surface tribes. The
Copts worship Isis, or the Moon—I
dunno which. Probably they’re the
same. Keep clear of them unless you’re
armed; don’t monkey with their religion;
and don’t enter any passages engraved
with the emblems of the Moon
and the sistrum.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Religion, youngster. No white man
has ever seen the Ka’aba—the Black
Stone—at Mecca. It’s sacred to the
Moslem, just as the Alu—the group of
deepest caverns—are sacred to the
Copts. They say Amon-Ra is down
there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy’s eyebrows lifted. “Amon-Ra?
The ancient Egyptian god?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right. ‘The Hidden Light.’ We
have a sort of armed truce with the
Copts, provided we don’t interfere too
much. When they get out of line, we
whip them back. Figuratively, of
course.” Brady’s hand touched the
buttoned holster at his thigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you say the sacred caves
were called?” Phil asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does it mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Land of Light.” Brady looked
around. His face was alight with interest.
“Have you studied Egyptology?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—afraid not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain’s eyes lost their glow.
“Um. Bit of a hobby of mine. Land
of Light—Hidden Light—Isis, the
Moon goddess—I’ve always wondered
what exists in Alu. Never found out.
Never expect to. But I shouldn’t be
surprised if there’s the wreckage of a
civilization down there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He chuckled. “Not that the commander
agrees with me—Commander
Desquer, you’ll be under him. But he
can’t tell me how the Pyramids were
built, or the explanation of so many
mysteries of Egypt. In my opinion,
space travel was understood ages before
Europeans achieved it. Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He
nodded thoughtfully. “A puzzle. A
nomadic civilization on the Nile, and
then, without warning, a civilization
full-blown and decadent. Where did it
come from? It was decadent when it
reached Egypt. I wonder .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to the controls. “Here’s
Azouad. Half an hour. You’ll find
plenty of shops. Don’t buy any wines—they
won’t keep in Sub-Sahara.
Brandy’s good. And pipes wear better
than cigarettes in the Legion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below the gyro was a patch of gray
on the brownish, rolling Sahara plain.
Small dots of faded green were visible,
trees struggling desperately for moisture
and life. In a clearing Captain
Brady set down the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All out,” he grunted. “<span class='it'>Parte!</span>
Half an hour, remember.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The brothers watched the lean figure
move briskly across the sun-baked
square, to disappear into the
depths of a cantina. Then they looked
at one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well!” Jimmy murmured. “So
we’re in the Legion!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sub-Sahara. Um. Come on; we’ve
only half an hour. Let’s look over
Azouad.” Tony hesitated, gripped
Phil’s arm, and glanced up. “That a
plane?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah.” Phil squinted aloft. “Wait
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not a government plane. Private.
Anyway, so what? There’s no extradition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” Tony said softly. “But
the Earth Star’s plenty valuable. Somebody
might have .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ideas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe I’d better mail it back
home,” Jimmy grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three glances crossed. And, curiously,
at that moment a shadow drifted
across the brothers—the shadow of a
plane, chilling them momentarily after
the blast of the African sun. It was
like an omen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil said, “I wonder which of us
really has it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” Tony remarked. “Come
along. I want a drink.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way, shouldering through
a crowd of assorted riff-raff, the usual
scum of a bordertown. Odors of sesame,
oils, and less familiar stenches
were sickeningly strong. Dozens of
mongrels roved hungrily about; the flies
were countless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They bought smokes and entered a
cantina, dark and muggy. A fat native
served them squareface gin, waddling
toward the dim corner where they
sat. Behind them, Tony noticed, was
a door, half opened less to permit fresh
air to enter than to allow foul to emerge.
He pushed it shut with a casual foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gin wasn’t good, but it was
strong. Also, it was inordinately expensive.
Jimmy made a wry face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hell of a lot of good money will do
us now. We’ve ten minutes. Think
we’ll like Sub-Sahara?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds—interesting,” Phil said
slowly. “Captain Brady’s certainly
hipped on his Land of Light. I wonder
what sort the Copts are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tough hombres,” Tony grunted.
There was a brief silence. The waiter
appeared, refilled glasses, and departed.
Then—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Merlin!</span>” a soft voice whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s fingers tightened around his
glass. Phil sat perfectly motionless.
Jimmy’s head jerked slightly; then he
was immobile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony looked around, and the others
followed his lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing beside them was a small,
round-faced man, his beady dark eyes
glinting beneath a sun-helmet, his tropical
whites looking freshly laundered.
His gaze swiveled sharply from one to
another of the trio. A shadow of disappointment
flickered over his features
and was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony said, “Who the devil are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stranger flashed white teeth.
“The private secretary of a certain Rajah.
One of you has seen me before.
I do not know which one. However—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s crazy,” Phil grunted. “Batty
as a bedbug. Drink up, boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Zadah,” the man went
on without heeding the interruption. “I
know that one of you is the Merlin and
has the Earth Star. I want it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony looked at the man. “Do you
think anybody’d who’d stolen a jewel
would be fool enough to keep it on
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Merlin would. Because he’d
want to make certain that a certain—deal—wouldn’t
ever be completed. An
imitation of the stone was made, so perfect
that the deception can be discovered
only by comparison with the original.
Someone might try to sell the
imitation as the original jewel—and the
Merlin could block such a transaction
only by producing the real Earth Star.
He won’t get rid of it. Not unless—he’s
forced to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony drank gin reflectively. “There’s
an offensive odor in this place,” he remarked.
“Notice it, anybody?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zadah said, “I do not want the police
to find you or the Earth Star. If I
recover it myself, the Rajah will pay
me any price to have the jewel—and the
original owners can prove nothing. My
private operatives have traced you this
far. Now—” He took out a small gun.
“You will stand up and walk one by
one through the door behind you. Stay
in single file. My plane is just near by.
We will fly to my country, and there—”
Again the teeth flashed. “There I think
it will not be too hard to learn which
of you is the Merlin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony hesitated, remembering the
plane he had seen in the sky. Zadah
held the gun almost hidden under his
coat, but of its deadliness there could be
no doubt. The brothers exchanged
glances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand up!” Zadah whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony obeyed. He turned toward the
door, opened it, and stepped out into
sunlight. The others followed. Zadah
said, “To the left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved slowly through an alley,
littered with refuse and foul with odors.
Not a soul was visible—only a stray
cur that ran past, tail between its legs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Across the square. The gun is in
my pocket, but I have my finger on the
trigger. Make no suspicious move.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s lips were white. He guessed
well enough what would happen once he
and his brothers were captives aboard
the plane. Zadah would not stop at
torture to achieve his ends. If only—</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no sign of help. Across
the square they went, toward a small
gyro in its center. Loungers in the
shadows of the low buildings eyed the
group incuriously as they passed. They
walked on, toward a cantina, past its
door—</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Brady came out. He
hesitated, his sunken eyes intent
on the spectacle. Then he moved like
an uncoiled spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zadah sensed danger. He started to
whirl, dragging his gun from his pocket.
But Brady’s hand chopped down viciously,
the edge of the palm smashing
against the secretary’s spine, at the nape
of the neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little grunt came from Zadah. He
went down like a wet sack of flour. Casually
Brady bent, picked up the gun,
and pocketed it. His humorless eyes
were without any hint of emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time to go,” he said. “Come along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently the brothers followed Brady
to the latter’s plane. Without a word
they took off, speeding south until the
desert-stain of Azouad was lost beneath
the horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And not once, during the journey, did
Captain Brady refer to the affair in
which he had played Saviour. Tony,
grinning to himself, remarked in an undertone,
“There’s no extradition from
the Legion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah,” Phil nodded. “The devil
protects his own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy said nothing. He was too
busy peering out at the rolling dunes
and endless plains of the Sahara.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sub-Sahara! Underground labyrinth—an
oasis under a burning, lifeless expanse
of wilderness! To the three Martells
it was, at first, a relief, after the
flaming heat of the desert. Though
even in the beginning there was a feeling
of oppression as the metal car sank
down into its shaft and the weight of
earth overhead was felt almost tangibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed hours later when the car
stopped and a panel in its bare side slid
open. Pale radiance flickered in through
the gap, lighting the men’s faces eerily.
The glow seemed to come from the walls
itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phosphorescent paint,” Brady said,
nodding. “Saves trouble. We spray the
walls and ceiling once a year, and it’s
bright enough for our needs. Come
along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four stepped out into a passageway.
It wasn’t long. It ended before
a metallic door; Brady took a rod from
his pocket and held it briefly pointed at
the lock. The panel opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond the threshold lay a cavern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Huge and dim and alien as a distant
world it seemed, a gigantic hollow hemisphere
in the solid Earth. It was, as
far as Tony could judge, about two
miles in diameter, with a jagged floor
that had been cleared in a few spots.
The dim light filtered down from the
ceiling, as sunlight through heavy cloud.
When Brady spoke, his voice was incongruous
in this place of silvery soft
grayness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s the fort. Over there—” He
pointed. “That’s the entrance to the
Coptic tunnels. We guard the entrance
to the surface. Though the Copts
haven’t tried to make any surface raids
for a long time.” He swung out along
a rough path, the others following.
“They hate the Bedouins, just as the
ancient Egyptians did. They don’t especially
dislike us, unless we get in their
way. If the mineral deposits the Copts
work weren’t valuable, though, they’d
be left to themselves. But the Legion’s
paid to make sure the mines are kept
active.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony didn’t answer. His eyes were
slowly accustoming themselves to this
strange light. He glanced up at a ceiling
that was both visible and invisible.
No details could be seen. A veil of
shining cloud seemed to obscure the
rock far above. The vault of a world,
Tony thought. A world created here,
perhaps, when the Sahara was a sea
instead of a desert. What had Brady
said a while ago? Something about a
prehistoric, mighty civilization in ante-dynastic
Egypt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and, far and far
below, the Copts still worshiped Isis, in
the hidden caverns of Alu where no
white man had ever penetrated. “The
wreckage of a civilization down there,”
Brady had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this eery cavern-world it was easy
to believe in almost anything. A scrap
of half-forgotten verse drifted through
Tony’s mind:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“<span class='it'>But you have seen the hieroglyphs on the great sandstone obelisks,</span></p>
<p class='line0'><span class='it'>And you have talked with Basilisks, and you have walked with hippogriffs</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>They were at the fort. Nothing could
be seen beyond a palisade of strong,
dully-gleaming metal. But a bell rang
sharply; a gate opened, and a man in
legionnaire uniform appeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in the odd light his face seemed
strangely pallid—drained of all color,
like bleached papyrus. He was gaunt
and fleshless almost to the point of
emaciation, so that his eyes and mouth
were black hollows. It seemed as
though a skull wore the rakish Legion
cap atop its dome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saluted, and Brady responded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Jacklyn. Tell Commander
Desquer I’m here.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Jacklyn stood aside to let the others
enter. Tony discovered that
within the palisade were a dozen metal
shacks, prefabricated, and without sign
of life. So this would be their home
from now on!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady said, “Well? Didn’t you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacklyn’s voice was strained. “Glad
you’re back, sir. The commander left
for the surface an hour ago. He got a
message.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There’s trouble, sir. The
Copts—they’ve kidnapped Ruggiero.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Brady looked at his fingernails.
“It’s full moon, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. I need four men. Completely
armed. We’ll leave as soon as
they’re ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacklyn hurried away. Tony asked,
“Is this—the usual thing, down here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady shook his head. “No. At full
moon the Copts choose a victim to represent
Osiris. The Husband of Isis.
Usually it’s all done quietly, and the
sacrifice is a Copt, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy inquired rather weakly,
“What sort of sacrifice is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Degenerate form of Egyptian religion.
According to legend, Seth, the
evil god, was jealous of Osiris. He put
him to death, tearing his body into fourteen
pieces. The Copts are .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. literal-minded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady sucked in his breath. “I wish
I knew more of their mythos. The
ceremony glorifies Isis of the Moon. A
Copt has always served before. But
now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He pulled at the clipped
gray moustache. “Ruggiero has been
taken to Alu to be sacrificed. This
means trouble—plenty of it.” But there
was no fear in the sunken eyes; only
excited anticipation. “Alu! The Land
of Light!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly Tony understood. For
years Brady had wondered about the
half-mythical cavern world below, a
place forbidden to him by rigid rules.
Now, in the absence of the commander,
it was Brady’s duty to rescue the kidnapped
legionnaire. His duty—and his
chance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony said, “Let us go with you, captain.
Eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy and Phil exchanged surprised
glances. Then Phil nodded. “Yeah!
How about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady hesitated. “You’re untrained.
You don’t know the ropes—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know how to handle guns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carbon-pistols?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can learn easily enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they’re simple. But—all
right,” the captain said with sudden decision.
“You’re new, and that means
you’re not scared stiff of Alu. The three
of you and Jacklyn. Right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bawled for the skull-faced man.
“Jacklyn! Get equipment! I’m taking
these three recruits. <span class='it'>Allons!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony grinned at his brothers. Their
introduction to the Legion was to be
exciting, after all—if not fatal!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Sub-Sahara</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Jacklyn said, “Fifty years nearly
I’ve been here. It never changes.
First time I’ve ever seen the Copts get
out of hand. Sure, they’d try to get
out once in a while to butcher the
Bedouins, but they never had anything
against us. Funny.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The group was marching swiftly
through a dim tunnel, Captain Brady
in the lead, the others trailing. They
had been moving for an hour, in a
labyrinth of passages through which
the captain unerringly found his way.
Now he looked back and remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. I know this maze
pretty well, but Jacklyn knows it blindfolded.
He’s practically a Copt himself.
Hasn’t been above ground for
fifty years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must like it here,” Jimmy remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacklyn said, very softly, “It’s hell.
You been in New York lately? Yeah?
How does the old burg look now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s changed in fifty years,” Phil
said. “But you know that already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Times Square, though—that’s there,
eh? I remember I used to feel empty
whenever I got out of the old town.
God, I’d like to see it again—but not
on a televisor. In fact,” he went on
slowly, “I’d like to smell fresh air again.
Not this artificial ventilation. See starlight
and green growing things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Sun,” Jimmy nodded understandingly.
He glanced at Jacklyn—and
then caught his breath at sight
of the expression on the legionnaire’s
pallid face. Horror—and hate!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was gone immediately. Jacklyn
ignored the remark. He said, “I was
one of the first spacemen. There’ve
been plenty of improvements since my
time, what with liquid fuels instead of
powder, and those new magnetic induced-gravity
screens they’re working
on. But it’s like shipping, I guess—steam
or sail, it’ll never really change.
There’ll be the sea under you, or space
around you. We—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sh-h!</span>” Brady held up a warning
finger. “Hold it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They paused, but no sound came.
The captain relaxed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought I heard an explosion.
Guess not. Well—by the way, are you
sure you know how to use the carbon-pistols?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not hard,” Tony said. He took
out his weapon, resembling an oversized
revolver with a cup-shaped hollow
where the hammer should have
been. From his pocket he withdrew a
bit of coal, slipped it into the cup,
where prongs held it firmly in place,
and hefted the gun. “Not so easy to
sight as a Colt, but the force-charge
scatters, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacklyn said, “Right. Watch the
recoil, though. Ease the trigger-button
down. And don’t run out of coal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny,” Tony remarked. “Coal
doesn’t seem much good in a pistol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Brady laughed a little. “The
thing’s based on atomic force—liberation
of quanta, though I don’t understand
the scientific principles of it myself.
Works only on carbon. Coal’s
carbon—and cheap. So, if the Copts
get out of hand, we fight ’em with the
coal they dig for us. Rather unfair,
but it’s all in the Legion’s work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Practically everything is,” Tony
said dryly. “How much farther, captain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been going down steadily—wait!
Here’s someone. Don’t touch
your guns unless I give the word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony stared ahead. For a second
he saw nothing; then abruptly the tunnel
was filled with a dozen bizarre figures.
Clad in skin-fitting garments of
unfamiliar texture, white-skinned, with
blue veins showing plainly through the
flesh, the men’s faces were aquiline
and strong, with beaked noses and
abnormally large eyes, in which the
pupils nearly eclipsed the irises. The
Copts’ hair—they had none on their
faces—was like bleached straw, tightly
curled. They seemed unarmed, yet
Brady’s whole body subtly tensed as he
stood waiting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foremost of the Copts, taller
than the rest, and wearing a tapering
headdress, came forward, hand lifted.
He spoke in English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Brady, why are you here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady said, “If any harm comes to
a legionnaire, it will not be well with
the Copts, priest.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The man nodded. “I understand.
That was a mistake. Some of our
younger men—they have already been
suitably punished for meddling in
affairs beyond them. Your legionnaire
is back in the fort, Captain Brady. You
will find him there if you return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony detected a half-veiled glance
the priest sent at his fellows. Brady
saw it also, and tugged at his moustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are speaking true words?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I speak true words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose we do not believe. Suppose
we—go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stir shook the Copts; they looked
at one another askance. The priest
said, “The Moon passages begin not
far from here. Those you may not
enter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady seemed undecided. “We shall
go back. But if our man is not safely
in the fort—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest’s smile was apparently
guileless. “He will be there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. About face! <span class='it'>Allons!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony turned with the others. But
before a foot was lifted there came an
interruption. The priest’s voice was
raised in an urgent command in an unfamiliar
tongue. He, with the others,
had seen the bloodstained, tattered,
huge figure that sprang out from concealment
behind a rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kill those men!” a bull voice
shouted. “Blast ’em down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Commander Desquer!” Brady
clipped—and then—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out guns!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For from the ranks of the Copts a
pale ray had lanced, striking full upon
Desquer’s bison chest, bared by a tattered
tunic. Another ray touched Tony;
he felt a wave of intolerable heat as he
snatched out the carbon-gun at his
belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Cr-rack!</span> Brady’s weapon snarled
viciously, and the heat-ray left Tony.
He slipped a coal-cartridge into the
cup and triggered almost without aiming.
The deadly little guns worked
havoc. But there were almost a dozen
Copts, and for a few moments the tunnel
was a chaotic Maelstrom of battle,
dominated by Desquer’s deep voice
roaring commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get them! All of them! Aim at
their bellies!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smoke drifted away. The Copts lay
in helpless huddles amid red stains.
Tony lowered his gun and stared
around anxiously. Jimmy was painfully
rubbing his arm where a heat-ray
had cindered the cloth. Phil was
apparently untouched, and so was Jacklyn,
but Captain Brady was rubbing
his thigh and cursing quietly. As for
Commander Desquer, it was impossible
to judge whether he had been injured
in the conflict. He was already
wounded in a dozen places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s fascinated gaze clung to the
man. The mighty body was thewed
like an auroch-bull, the matted, deep
chest heaving convulsively with exhaustion.
The commander’s head was
shaved, but nevertheless there was
something leonine about his face.
Shaggy, tufted eyebrows overhung
glittering small eyes, and thick, sensual
lips were pressed tightly together.
Desquer reminded Tony, somehow, of
a Nero or a Caligula—a degenerate
Roman despot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Desquer flung back his huge
head in an arrogant gesture. “Jacklyn!
See if the priest’s got a healing-ray. We
need it.” As the legionnaire hurried
forward the commander turned his eyes
to the others. Tony felt a curious
shiver ripple down his spine as the
cold gaze touched him. Desquer looked
long and intently at Tony, and not until
he had stared equally long at Phil
and Jimmy did he turn his attention
to Brady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fort’s gone,” he said. “The
Copts smashed it and massacred every
man. They blew up the shaft to the
surface just after I reached Sub-Sahara.
I just managed to get away .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
cavern’s overrun with ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacklyn came back with a small flat
box, in which a lens was set. He
touched a button and turned the lens
to focus upon Brady’s thigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. up a bit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You know
they kidnapped Ruggiero?”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer nodded “Yes. I found
a Copt alone and induced him to
give me a little information.” He
glanced at his hands, took out a small
knife, and began to clean his nails.
“What this means I don’t know. A
<span class='it'>jehad</span>—a holy war, possibly. Though
it’s without precedent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The captain lifted his hand.
“Enough, Jacklyn. Tend to the commander.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Desquer shook his head impatiently.
“No time.” He drew
Brady aside, as Jacklyn turned to the
others. The two officers withdrew a
few steps and lowered their voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony stared at the lensed box as
Jacklyn used it on Jimmy’s arm. “What
the devil’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A gadget the Copts have. Nobody
knows how it works. They don’t themselves.
It was handed down .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it’s
a ray that increases cell activity. Builds
up cell tissue. Prevents infection .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
how’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swell,” said Jimmy, touching his
arm. “It still hurts a bit, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t for long—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer said, “You three recruits—listen
to me. We’re going down. Into
Alu. Jacklyn, you’ll go for help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The skull-faced legionnaire’s body
jerked convulsively. He stared at the
commander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For—help?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer nodded. “Right. You know
these caves. There are other openings
to the surface. Get help. We’ll hide
out and wait for you. The Copts won’t
expect us to go right to their headquarters,
so that’s just what we’ll do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—” Jacklyn moistened dry
lips. “I’ll have to go to the surface?”
There was a curious note of horror in
his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t argue. Move! You’ll have
a better chance alone than with companions,
so—<span class='it'>allez!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jacklyn moved a pace away, stopped,
and turned back. He said woodenly,
“I can’t go to the surface, Commander.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer said very softly, “Why
not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sunlight will kill me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a little silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was space-burned. That’s why
I joined the Legion. It’s a kind of
allergy, you know—I was so badly
burned in space by direct solar rays
that even filtered sunlight will kill me
now in a few hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony felt his stomach move sickeningly.
So that was why Jacklyn had
remained in Sub-Sahara for fifty years.
A prison with its mockery of freedom—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let one of the others go, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go,” Jimmy offered—but
Desquer snarled at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence! You know these caves,
Jacklyn—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The captain knows them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s badly burned. That heat-ray
touched the bone. He couldn’t stand
a long trek. Here!” Desquer bent
over the dead Copts and rapidly began
to strip them of their garments.
“If sunlight will kill you, stay out of
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the desert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bandages, you fool—bandages!
Wrap yourself up in these. Travel by
night if you have to, after you reach
the surface.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently Jacklyn began to don the
garments. He said without expression,
“It will kill me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer threw him an armful of
clothes and grinned. “You’ll live long
enough to get help. If the Copts break
out of Sub-Sahara, it’ll be like rounding
up a thousand fleas. Besides, I
don’t know what’s back of this—but
it’s nothing small, I can promise you.
If—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leaped like a panther. His shod
foot came down with a sickening crunch
on flesh and bone. Tony, startled by
the sudden movement, saw that
Desquer had sprung upon the Coptic
priest, from whose hand a ray-projector
had dropped. The priest’s blood-smeared
face, twisted in agony, lifted
toward the ceiling as he cried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not dead, eh?” Desquer whispered,
his voice taut with savage fury. “Well—you
soon will be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew back his foot. But the
priest’s lifted arm somehow halted him.
The Copt dragged himself half erect.
His thin voice shrilled, “Go down to
Alu, fools! But you will be too late.
Isis has risen—and with her the gods
who dwell in Alu. Before the opening
to the outer world can be cleared again,
we shall have triumphed—and the
Earth will tremble before the power
of the Ancients! Aye—the Ancients
who ruled over the Four Rivers before
their sons fled to Egypt!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go down to Alu, fools! <span class='it'>You shall
find death!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priest fell back—and died.</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Five Against the Gods</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Hours had passed. The legionnaires,
headed by Commander
Desquer, were encamped by a small,
rocky inlet on the Midnight Sea, a
fathomless lake of inky water that
stretched beyond the limit of vision.
A pallid glow came from the cavern
roof far above, rippling over the surface
of the tideless, sluggish sea. It
was a scene fantastic almost beyond
belief, and Tony, on guard at the mouth
of a crevasse where the others slept,
could scarcely realize that he was still
on Earth, and not beneath the surface
of some alien world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had come far and fast, slipping
stealthily past the guards the Copts
had posted, taking advantage of every
unused tunnel, guided more by instinct
than by knowledge. The city of the
Copts they had skirted, descending
ever deeper to the forbidden gates of
Alu. And now, on the shore of the
Midnight Sea, they were ready for the
plunge into the unknown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t stay here,” Desquer
grunted. “They’d find us sooner or
later. But in Alu we have a chance.
The element of surprise will be on our
side, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right. Tony knew. He
shifted uneasily, glancing at the carbon
pistol and checking its load. His
thoughts went back to New York, and
the civilization of a world that seemed
a billion miles distant. A world lost to
him—and his brothers—forever. And
in exchange they had gained—this!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hand fell on Tony’s shoulder.
Desquer said, “All right. We’re marching.”
The commander’s heavy jaw jutted
as he stared out over the water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others appeared one by one,
ragged, disheveled, and unshaved.
Brady was wincing with the pain in his
stiffened leg as he walked. Jimmy’s
face was haggard; he had not the stamina
of the others. But Phil seemed as
sturdy and untroubled as ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer turned; his cold eyes took
stock of his command. “All right.
March!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way. Brady behind him.
The brothers followed. Tony caught a
wink from Phil, and lagged behind
somewhat, till the officers were out of
earshot of a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil’s hand touched his tunic pocket.
“Somebody searched me while I was
asleep. I thought I was dreaming, but
when I woke up, this pocket was unbuttoned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s eyebrows lifted. “Oh-oh!”
He squinted ahead. “Who—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dunno. But—somebody. Just
thought I’d tell you. We’d better keep
our eyes peeled after this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil exchanged a meaningful glance
with Tony and increased his pace. The
latter frowned, trying to figure out what
this new development meant. The
Earth Star? It was scarcely probable
that anyone in Sub-Sahara would know
the details of the theft and its aftermath.
More likely the motive was
merely petty robbery—unless, indeed,
Phil had actually dreamed it. But in
his heart, somehow, Tony sensed impending
danger. The baleful fires of
the Earth Star still burned far below
the surface of the planet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer? He could scarcely know
anything of the jewel. Brady? Perhaps
the encounter with Zadah, the
Rajah’s secretary, had aroused the captain’s
suspicions. Or—Jimmy? Was
he searching for the Earth Star, trying
to learn which of his brothers carried
it? That might have been more plausible
had not Jimmy kept insisting, with
his brothers, that he himself had stolen
the gem.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s face did not change, but his
hand touched the butt of the carbon-pistol.
He felt safer with the
weapon at his thigh. For a time he
plodded on, every sense alert for sign
of danger. The immediate peril was
from the Copts, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of the underground race appeared
as the group skirted the Midnight
Sea. They came at last to a tunnel
mouth where Desquer paused, hesitating,
to confer with Brady. The latter
pointed to a sign cut out of the rock
above the entrance—a full moon surmounted
by a crescent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moon and sistrum,” the captain
nodded. “This is one of the forbidden
gateways. A door to Alu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer grunted. “Very well. Come
along. Watch out for traps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They entered the tunnel. It was
darker, though a vague illumination filtered
from the walls and roof, due, perhaps,
to some sort of radioactivity. The
passage slanted down steeply. It was
apparently little used, and in spots almost
blocked by debris, where the legionnaires
had to crawl through painfully.
Desquer’s bull strength came in
useful there. The giant commandant
was untiring, and there came a time
when he was almost carrying Brady
along as the captain’s weak leg grew
weaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder if Jacklyn will make it,”
Jimmy muttered to Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows. If he doesn’t, we’re in
the soup.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil grinned. “What if he does?
We’re still in Alu!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tunnel grew steeper. Now half-obliterated
carvings were visible on the
walls, symbols that bore the trace of
immeasurable antiquity. One sign puzzled
Tony; it was a cross within a circle.
It reminded him, somehow, of the
dying Coptic priest’s words—“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
the Ancients who ruled over the Four
Rivers before their sons fled to Egypt.”
The circled cross struck a chord of
memory in Tony’s mind, and he knew,
somehow, that the cross was supposed
to represent four rivers. But—try as
he might—he could recall no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were other carvings, most of
them showing the sistrum and the lunar
disk. They had been cut out of the
rock, Tony felt, long before the Pharaohs
had reigned in Egypt, before the
uraeus crown had come to represent a
dynasty. A little chill touched Tony
as he thought of the endless centuries
that had ravaged the world above and
left the road to Alu untouched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Egypt—a civilization. And in
Alu—<span class='it'>what</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>No premonition troubled Commander
Desquer. His great frame marched on
untiringly, practically carrying the exhausted
Brady. Down and down they
went. Tony’s legs began to ache, and
Jimmy was drooping with fatigue.
Phil’s stolid face showed no emotion,
but there were lines of strain about his
mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down—and down! Into Earth’s secret
heart—into the forbidden land.
And what caused Tony the most uneasiness
was the fact that they went on unchallenged.
Perhaps the Copts had not
discovered the intruders. Or, perhaps,
the Copts knew that there was no need
to guard the road to Alu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally Tony would intercept a
glance from Desquer, who would impartially
stare at the three brothers as
though in puzzled curiosity. But the
commander said nothing, till at last they
came out in a large cavern from which
three tunnel-mouths opened, besides the
one on the threshold of which they
stood. Desquer paused, his gaze searching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll camp here,” he said shortly.
“In the middle. That way, our retreat
won’t be cut off if the Copts find us.
That middle passage is our road. Eh,
Captain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady nodded. “Yes. The Moon
and sistrum is over it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence the five moved wearily to
the center of the cavern and dropped
rather than relaxed on the rock floor.
They were tired out. Desquer alone sat
straddle-legged, his gun ready in his
hand, icy eyes flashing about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sleep,” he said. “I’ll guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony gratefully obeyed. Stillness
closed over the cave. But—it was
broken.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Very faintly, as though from an infinite
distance, came a rhythmic
chanting. Muffled and scarcely audible
it whispered, almost below the threshold
of hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady’s breath hissed between his
teeth. “Hear that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer said, “Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Chant of Set. Somewhere
they’re beginning the ceremony of Osiris,
where they’ll sacrifice Ruggiero.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony said, “That’s where they tear
the victim into pieces, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Commander—” Brady didn’t
finish. One look at Desquer’s grim face
was enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a fool, captain. Get your
rest—and the rest of you, too. You’ll
need it. You know well enough we
can’t rescue Ruggiero.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, Tony thought as he relaxed,
was true; but nevertheless he had a
curiously unpleasant feeling at the base
of his spine. Somewhere amid these
caverns a white man was being horribly
sacrificed, and it was not a thought conducive
to sound sleep. Yet Desquer
was right. The legionnaires’ only chance
was to remain hidden .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once Tony roused sleepily to find the
Commander lying down and Captain
Brady on guard. Brady was wandering
about the cavern, staring up at the carving
of the Moon and sistrum. He was
a gaunt, scarecrow figure in the dim
light. As Tony drifted off again to sleep
he realized that the faint chanting had
grown louder—</p>

<p class='pindent'>That it was different now in tone—triumphant!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then Desquer was shaking
Tony’s shoulder, his hand pressed over
the legionnaire’s lips. The commander’s
eyes were glittering brightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Sh-h!</span> Not a sound! Rouse the
others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently Tony obeyed. There was no
sign of Captain Brady, he realized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On cat feet Desquer led the three into
the tunnel. Hidden by the first turn,
he whispered, “Brady’s gone. When I
woke up—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy asked, “What happened to
him? The Copts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But wouldn’t they have killed us,
then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer passed a hand over his
shaven head. “Not necessarily. They
may have other plans.” He smiled, not
pleasantly. “So Brady’s gone. That
leaves the four of us.” There was an
oddly secretive look in the cold eyes.
“Come on. We’re still heading for
Alu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the use?” Tony asked. “If
the Copts have discovered us—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They may not have. Brady may
have gone off to try and save Ruggiero.
I doubt that, though—but we mustn’t
overlook any chances. Alu is our destination.
So—<span class='it'>allons!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three brothers exchanged
glances. One by one their number was
being cut down. First the entire garrison
of the fort; then Jacklyn; now
Captain Brady. Tony felt a twinge of
sympathy for the weatherbeaten old soldier.
Whatever had happened to the
man, Brady would have gone down
fighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t try to warn us,” Jimmy
muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer grunted. “We don’t know all
the weapons of those Copts. Where
they get them God knows. Every once
in a while they’ll pop up with some
super-scientific device far beyond their
power to manufacture. It’s a mystery.
Maybe we’ll find the answer in Alu.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That, to Tony, was a strange paradox.
A search amid the ruins of a forgotten
past for the super-science of the
future. And yet—whence had come
the mighty civilization of Egypt?
What mystery lay behind the cryptic
powers of the Copts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There could be no answer, as yet.
The four men marched on, down into
the depths. They were beneath the
Midnight Sea now, Tony decided, since
the tunnel had curved in a long loop.
Not only beneath the Sahara Desert,
but under a sunken sea as well.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Endlessly the road stretched before
them. But the end came unexpectedly.
So exhausted were the
four that they scarcely realized that
the silvery radiance of the tunnel had
given place to a reddish glow, brighter
and reminiscent of volcanic activity.
Desquer lifted his hand in warning.
He went on to reconnoitre, and presently
beckoned the others. His burly
figure was rigid, Tony saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, as he went on, he saw something
else. The tunnel ended. It
opened upon a cavern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cavern that was a world!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A world beneath a desert and a sea!
Alu, the Land of Light, lay before the
adventurers, and human eyes had never
gazed upon a stranger sight. A metropolis
of antiquity, with the wrecks
of mighty buildings and fallen pillars
strewing the flat floor of the cave. It
was like Pompeii, and far older than
Pompeii. It was grander than Karnak,
more alien than crumbling Ang-kor-Vat.
In the distance a pyramid
rose toward the roof of the cave—touching
it, supporting it as the fabled
tree Yggdrasil is supposed to support
the Earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Red light flamed from beyond the
pyramid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alu! Old beyond imagination, cradle
of a race that had ruled long and
long ago! Alu, which the Egyptians
had incorporated into their mythology
as their heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheer, overwhelming majesty of
the panorama struck the men dumb, as
a hand might strike an impious lip.
Huge and desolate and dead the lost
world stretched before them, holding
its secret fast, as it had held it since
before the Pharaohs reigned. No wonder
the pyramids were a mystery—built
by some alien science. The same
science that had reared the colossal
structures of Alu!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hundred feet away a square white
marble building towered, Doric pillars
on either side of its open gateway.
Some indefinable urge drew Tony’s
eyes to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer said, “Hear that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The others listened, but detected no
sound. The commander grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It came from that temple. Get
your guns ready. We’re going in. If
there’s trouble, shoot first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four moved softly across the
flat rock of the floor. Halfway to the
door of the building Jimmy clutched
Tony’s arm. He pointed, his face
chalk-white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony followed his brother’s gaze, as
did the others. Far away were two
structures connected by an arched
span. Across this span figures were
moving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Figures with human bodies—but inhuman
heads!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the distance it was impossible to
make out details, but it was plain that
there was something definitely abnormal
about the beings who walked
across the span. They moved in stately
file and were gone. Jimmy whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember what the priest said?
The gods live in Alu!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony thought of the Egyptian gods,
men with the heads of beasts and birds
and reptiles. Could some monstrous
hybrids have survived in this cavern?
He shrugged off the thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Masks, Jimmy! Don’t be an idiot.
Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer urged them toward the
square building. “Quick! We can
hide here, until we know more about
this place. Keep your guns ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commander’s icy eyes were
searching the gloom of the temple as
they crossed the threshold. The symbol
of Osiris, sign of the horned bull,
was carved everywhere. Crumbling,
broken pillars made the interior of the
temple a labyrinth. The floor was littered
with smashed blocks of stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very dim here, but one ray of
red light flamed like a sword-blade
through a gap in the wall and fell directly
upon the throne that stood on a
dais at the farther end of the room.
Tony and the others looked down a
long aisle toward the throne and the
statue upon it—the statue of a man,
clad in stylized flowing robes, with the
head of a bull upon the human shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on!” Desquer whispered.
He gripped his gun. Tony felt the butt
of his own weapon cold against his
palm as he walked on. The approach
to the dais seemed endless. Incredible
journey amid the wreckage of a forgotten
civilization! So might a lost
soul have journeyed to Osiris .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A
scrap of verse came unbidden to Tony.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“<span class='it'>Ten hundred shaven priests did bow to Ammon’s altar day and night,</span></p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Desquer stopped. His figure stood
rock-still for a moment. The gun
swung up, aimed at the statue on the
throne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Tony saw what the commander
had already realized. It was
no statue that faced them. The being
was alive!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>Before the Gods</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Only one thing could have stopped
Desquer’s finger on the trigger—and
that thing happened. The monster
on the throne spoke. Thick and almost
unintelligible, its voice poured out from
the inhuman muzzle, as the hands
twitched on the arms of the throne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” the bull-headed creature
moaned. “It’s Brady—Brady!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sheer amazement petrified Desquer.
He lowered his gun at last, shaved
scalp shining with sweat. Tony swallowed
a lump in his dry throat, glaring
at the hybrid on the dais.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady? Captain Brady?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those devils did this to me,” the
thick voice went on. “Surgery, commander—super-surgery.
Remember their healing ray? They grafted the
flesh and skin of a bull on to my head
and speeded up the cellular activity
tremendously with their ray. I—I
don’t dare move. This head is so heavy
it would snap my spine if—if—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer said in a low voice, “Are
we in danger now?” His eyes searched
the shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re doomed,” Brady mouthed.
“Thotmes told me the hellish plan behind
all this. Thotmes is the high
priest. He’s one of the very few that
know the secret of Alu. He told me—almost
everything. It tickled his ego,
I think, to gloat over his triumph .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull head lolled forward and
came back into place again abruptly.
Brady said, “Maybe there’s a chance.
I don’t know. Your guns .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Listen!
If you can get to the pyramid and blast
the machine out of existence—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What machine?” Desquer asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The machine that will destroy
Europe! The same kind of machine
that created Earth’s Moon, ages ago!
The machine that sank Atlantis!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s breath caught in his throat.
Atlantis? Now he remembered the
significance of the sign of the cross-and-circle.
It was the symbol of Atlantis,
the four rivers on the island continent.
Softly he whispered, “The Ancients
who ruled over the Four Rivers
before their sons fled to Egypt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady said, “Yes. That’s the secret
of Egypt, and its civilization. Men
have guessed at that before now. Ages
ago, when Europe was filled with nomadic
tribes, Atlantis was a continent
of culture and science. It was unstable—volcanic
activity went on endlessly
beneath it. And the land began to sink.
Thotmes told me how the scientists of
Atlantis planned to prevent their doom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They made a Moon. Out of the
bed of the Pacific Ocean they tore part
of the Earth and sent it driving out
into space. They thought that would
release the pressure under Atlantis and
save their civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They failed. The forces they controlled
were too mighty. Atlantis sank,
taking with it a science such as the
world has never known and perhaps
may never know again. But before the
deluge, a few Atlanteans fled eastward,
through the Pillars of Hercules, to
Egypt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bull head nodded. “They were
the ancestors of the underground
Copts. They found Sub-Sahara centuries
before the Pharaohs, and they
found Alu. There they built a city
such as had existed in the Atlantean
valleys. They sent forth some of their
number to civilize the Nile peoples, and
those Atlanteans became the high
priests of the gods. They created the
gods!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As they created me—they made
gods with heads of bulls and crocodiles
and jackals, to terrify the superstitious
tribes that needed tangible gods to
worship. And then the road to the surface
was closed by some ancient cataclysm,
so that the Atlanteans were
trapped here. Some few of the priests
kept their culture. The others degenerated.
They became—the Copts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the priests still kept the old
religion alive, using their surgery and
their healing-rays to make new gods,
and ruling the Copts through fear.
Now they plan to make a second Moon,
and to raise Atlantis; they wish to rule
the Earth as they did once, long ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brady’s thin hands clenched into
fists. “They caught me in the cavern
where I was standing guard—used
some sort of paralyzing ray on me.
They brought me down here and told
me what they intend. There’s a machine
that’s capable of ripping all
Europe from the face of the Earth and
sending it out in space, to be another
Moon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony said, “But that would wreck
the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is part of their plan. They
have lost all their science, possessing
only a few machines and devices that
have come down since the days of the
Atlantean exodus. And these are gradually
losing their power. In sunken
Atlantis Thotmes and his followers can
find weapons and secrets that will enable
them to rule the world. But first
they plan to make another moon—to
destroy Europe—and to wreck most of
the Earth with quakes, tidal waves,
and storms. They’ll be safe here in
Alu. They’ll emerge after the Atlantic
has drained into the great abyss that
will be left by the destruction of
Europe, and they’ll return to Atlantis,
west of the Canary Islands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A machine to make a Moon!”
Desquer’s voice was almost scornful.
“Unbelievable!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was done once. The principle is
that of vibration. A file of men marching
in unison can shake down a bridge—you
know that. The right vibration
can wreck a building. Sonic waves
can disrupt the molecular framework
of the Earth, and Thotmes has a machine
that can be focused <span class='it'>through</span> the
body of the planet. There will be little
temblors in Europe at first, then heavy
quakes. They will grow stronger.
And finally the entire continent will be
ripped away, and centrifugal force will
carry it out to its orbit. Thotmes explained
it in detail .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The bull head jerked forward suddenly.
There was a sharp, brittle
snap. And, slowly, the body of Captain
Brady leaned and bent. It toppled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer sprang forward with a
curse. He touched the monstrous
muzzle, jerked his hand away, and
then felt for Brady’s heart-beat. After
a moment he shrugged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he told us enough. Now
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” The commander stood up, his
gaze traveling slowly from face to face.
“Now we must find that machine and
destroy it—eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed vaguely displeased when
the three brothers nodded as one. But
his words were commonplace enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We need information. <span class='it'>Bon.</span> First,
we must find someone who can supply
it. Preferably this Thotmes—but we
cannot pick and choose, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy said on impulse, “You believe
Captain Brady’s story?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For answer Desquer waved his hand
around. “Look at this. No modern
civilization built it. I’ve lived in Sub-Sahara
for a long time, and—well, at
least I’ll verify the story before I act.
Let me remind you that it is not your
business to ask questions.” His cold
gaze held the youngster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony said quickly, “I’ll get the information,
commander.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer nodded. “Very well. I
need tell you nothing you do not already
know. Most of the Copts know
English; if not, bring your captive
back here. We shall wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony looked once at the sprawled,
terrible body that had been Captain
Brady, waved casually to Phil and
Jimmy—and went out. Along the
shadowed aisle of pillars he hurried,
pausing only when he emerged from
the temple. There, crouching in the
dimness, he paused, looking about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no sign of life. In the
distance loomed the tunnel mouth by
which they had entered Alu. Tony slid
along the side of the building and
peered gingerly around the corner. He
could see the arched ramp along which
the “gods” had passed, but it was vacant
now. What was the logical course
to pursue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lost city stretched about for
miles, an apparently tenantless ruin.
Yet it was peopled, Tony knew, by
Thotmes the high priest and his servitors—perhaps
by Copts, though probably
not, since the latter were confined
to their own city above. At the
thought Tony involuntarily glanced up.
Beyond the cavern roof was the Midnight
Sea, above that the Coptic city,
and still further above, Sub-Sahara itself.
The weight of innumerable tons
of Earth pressing down on him was
almost suffocating. However—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony shook off the feeling and set
out at random, after taking careful
bearings. He had a compass, but it
was useless in this environment, as he
found after brief experimentation.
But he could gauge direction fairly
well from the great pyramid, which
was visible from almost any point in
the city of Alu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept in the shadows, which were
concealingly dark where the flickering
red light did not shine. What caused
that volcanic glow Tony did not know,
though he hazarded a few guesses. He
went toward the pyramid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a metropolis of the dead.
Eons ago it had been inhabited, by the
survivors of sunken Atlantis, but now
only the dust of ages filled it. Silence,
and everywhere the symbol of Isis,
Moon-goddess, carved upon the stones.
Silence .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pyramid drew nearer, and Tony
was amazed anew at its hugeness. It
towered up and up to the very ceiling
of the cavern, seeming to support it
like a pillar. Perhaps it did—he could
not tell. But as he came closer he saw
that the pyramid was hollow, for there
were lighted embrasures here and there
in the sloping expanse of its sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still there was no sound, no
movement, no trace of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony grew more cautious, though
there seemed no need. An arched
opening loomed in the side of the pyramid
near him, and he slunk toward it
watchfully. No guards were posted.
He hesitated near the threshold.
Should he take the risk of entering
what might be a stronghold of his
enemies? To search the deserted city
was seemingly a vain task, and, shrugging,
Tony walked boldly toward the
opening. But his gun was in his hand,
and a coal-cartridge in its cup, ready
for instant use.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>A passageway sloped upward
within the pyramid. It was
lighted dimly by gleaming bars like
neon-tubes that ran the length of the
ceiling. In the vague glow Tony went
stealthily on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The corridor was featureless and
without doors—at first. But, suddenly,
he noticed what had at first
evaded his attention, a series of panels
set in the walls. The secret of their
locks was beyond him, until at last
one seemed simpler than the others.
Tony pressed a spring that was not too
deftly hidden—and the panel opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked through metal bars into a
great cage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Briefly he thought of a menagerie,
and then went sick and dizzy with
nausea. This was, indeed, a “zoo”—but
it did not hold animals. It held—gods!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artificial monsters created by
Thotmes and his servants roamed
within the cage, men with the heads of
teratological mythos. Here, indeed,
were the gods of Egypt, jackal-headed,
ibis-headed, bull-headed, even some
with the heads of crocodiles set hideously
upon the human shoulders. So
brightly lit was the cage that the beings
did not see Tony, and he drew back
swiftly, closing the panel. Obviously
he could get no information here. He
suppressed a strong impulse to use his
carbon-gun to put these pitiful beings
out of the unending nightmare of their
existence. If this was a sample of
Thotmes’ power, it would not be well
for the Atlantean to rule over Earth!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony went on along the corridor.
From his slight knowledge of Egyptology,
he knew that not all of the gods
were malevolent, like Set. Both Osiris
and Amon-Ra were benevolent, and so,
indeed, was Isis. Perhaps in the beginning
the whole religion had been a
good one, and had become decadent
and degenerate with the passage of
ages in this hidden cavern-world. The
obvious parallel was Satanism .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet this wasn’t a question of superstition.
It was one of logic and science,
of cold facts in which the mythology of
a race had been rooted. Behind the
veil of so-called “magic” lay an alien
and powerful culture, born in Atlantis
long before Ur and Akkad had risen in
Sumeria, along the Tigris and Euphrates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On and on Tony went, a cold uneasiness
rising within him. No one appeared
to bar his path. More than
once he glanced at the carbon-gun—but
he was unprepared when the floor
dropped beneath him, and he fell, writhing
and twisting, into darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He landed heavily on a hard surface,
and went down with a grunt and an
oath. Before he could rise, he felt the
weight of muscular bodies upon him.
Handicapped by the darkness, he
fought doggedly, but the gun was torn
from his grasp almost at the outset of
the struggle. He was not in complete
blackness; there was a vague dim glow,
but Tony’s eyes were not conditioned
to it, as those of his enemies were. At
last he lay prostrate, held motionless
by iron hands that gripped him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep voice murmured a command.
The light grew brighter. Tony blinked,
staring up from his position spread-eagled
on a stone floor. He discovered
that he was in a bare chamber, with a
barred door of metal grating set in one
wall. Five strong-thewed Copts held
him—but almost immediately Tony
saw that they were not Copts. Their
faces lacked the degeneracy of the
underground mining race. They were
cruel instead of stupid. Cruel—and
arrogant, proud! Proud with the
knowledge of a culture that stretched
back into the mists of a lost antiquity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One man stood against the wall—and
he was a giant. He wore a short
spade beard, and soft, glossy black
hair fell in curled, oily ringlets about
his face. He was handsome with the
beauty of a sword-blade, strong and
powerful and deadly, and his beaked
nose was hooked like a scimitar. Pale
blue eyes watched Tony unwinkingly.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>In not-quite-perfect English, he said,
“I am Thotmes.” Tony could not
repress a slight movement, and the
blue eyes narrowed; but the priest
merely smiled. “You know me? That
is strange. Perhaps you have spoke
to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Osiris!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded to the priests, who relaxed
their grip on Tony. The legionnaire
sprang up, but made no hostile
movement. He stood silent, watching
Thotmes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Atlantean stroked his beard.
“You are wise. This will be your prison,
and, if you cause no trouble, you
can live for a time. We do not murder
unnecessarily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only nine-tenths of the world’s population,”
Tony said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” Thotmes smiled, “is necessary.
We are a handful, against billions.
Not even the powers we shall
recover from Atlantis would enable us
to conquer Earth—unless Earth is already
conquered, her navies and aircraft
and weapons smashed by cataclysms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You actually expect to make a second
Moon?” Tony’s voice held skepticism.
But the priest was not offended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Such a thing was done once
before. The machine that made the
Moon was built in Atlantis, and we
have built a duplicate here. It took
centuries, but at last it is finished. In
the heart of the pyramid it lies—and
already it is in operation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In operation?” Involuntarily Tony
glanced around. “I don’t—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You feel nothing here and now, of
course. Later you may, though we are
safe in Alu. The machine sets up vibration
and molecular disruption in
certain strata under Europe, and gradually
the intensity of the vibration will
be increased—until Europe shakes itself
literally to pieces. In a week or
even less the final cataclysm will take
place. Europe will vanish, leaving an
abyss into which the waters of the Atlantic
will pour. And Atlantis will rise
again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” said Tony, “will be Old
Home Week, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thotmes didn’t answer. He turned
to the others and gestured. One of
them slid open the barred grating, and
the group filed out. The door slammed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond it, Thotmes smiled at his
captive. “Your companions will join
you soon. We shall not trouble to
search for them. They will walk into
our midst soon enough, and then you
will have company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out you don’t get your head
blown off by one of them,” Tony remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thotmes lost his smile. He tugged
at his spade beard and said, “Few men
jest in Alu. There is always a need
for new gods—and you would look well
with a jackal’s head on your shoulders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d look lovely with a rat’s,”
Tony agreed, “only you already have
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The high priest said something indistinguishable,
glared and departed.
Tony was left alone. He shrugged and
took stock of his possessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been searched completely.
His pockets were empty. Carbon-gun
and coal-cartridges had been taken
from him. He had no tool by which
he might leave the cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, there might possibly
be a concealed panel somewhere.
It took an hour for Tony to convince
himself that none existed. Finally he
sat down and waited. There was nothing
else to do. He had got the information
for which he had come. The
machine of the Atlanteans was in the
heart of the pyramid. But he was unarmed,
and had no way of conveying
a message to Desquer or his brothers.
Briefly he wondered what was happening
to Phil and Jimmy, and how long
they would wait. And when they got
tired of waiting—what would they do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could they do—trapped in Alu,
city of science and fathomless antiquity?
Four men, Desquer and the brothers,
against the mighty powers of the
greatest civilization Earth had ever
known. Four against the might that
had made Egypt an invincible empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four against the gods!</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The Might of Atlantis</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A thump from above brought Tony
from his crouching position to
stand rigidly erect, gaze riveted to the
ceiling. He was in time to see a section
of it swing down on hinges, letting
the body of a man, with arms and legs
flailing, drop into the prison. Tony
sprang forward, breaking the man’s
fall. It was Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil’s blond hair was disheveled, a
stubble of yellow beard on his face;
but his stocky body was as steel-muscled
as ever. He still gripped the
carbon-gun he had been holding, and
his eyes met Tony’s with relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You okay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah.” There was no need for
more, so deep was the understanding
between the brothers. Tony said
swiftly, “Anybody after you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t see anybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Took ’em by surprise, perhaps.
But they’ll be along. We’ve got to work
fast while we’ve a chance of getting
out of here.” He glanced at the barred
door. “We could blast out there with
the carbon-gun, but I don’t know the
road. Hop on my shoulders, kid.
We’re going out through the ceiling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil handed his brother the gun and
climbed deftly onto Tony’s shoulders
as the latter knelt. Slowly he rose,
steadying Phil with one hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got—got worried about you when
you didn’t show up. I went after you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See if you can open the panel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Jimmy all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s okay. The kid’s pretty tough
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Got it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hinged panel slid down as Phil’s
stubby fingers closed over the edge of
the opening. Tony heaved up strongly.
For a second Phil hung there; then
his body wriggled up, and his weight
was gone from Tony’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simultaneously a cry came from beyond
the barred door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pale ray lanced out. Tony felt a
twinge of agony in his side. Involuntarily
he flung up the carbon-gun and
fired. The metal door vanished in a
blaze of white fires. Whoever had been
beyond it had also disappeared without
trace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there were others coming. Tony
traded shots with them. He heard
Phil’s voice and risked a glance up.
Phil was lying flat, his arm extended
down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jump for it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t,” Tony said. “They’d wing
me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to. I can hear them
coming up here, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beat it. Get back to Desquer. Tell
him the machine’s in the base of this
pyramid. I’m going out this way;
there’ll be a better chance of one of us
getting through if we take different
routes. Beat it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause, punctuated by
the snarl of the carbon-gun. Then Phil
said, “Okay. Luck!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His feet scraped on the stone above.
The panel slammed shut. Tony made
a wry face, realizing that Phil was unarmed.
But he had a better chance of
escape than Tony himself, for a dozen
or more of priests was blocking the
passage that led—perhaps!—to freedom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony fired again. The foremost of
the priests went down, and the others
hesitated. The gun crackled savagely.
One priest broke and fled—and the
others followed.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Tony hurried after them, every
sense on the alert. The passage
was apparently bare, and silent save
for the dying thump of flying feet; but
he guessed that there might be traps.
Would this road lead to escape? And—had
Phil escaped safely? There was
no way of knowing—yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The passage stretched empty before
Tony. He gripped the gun, feeling in
its cold metal a reassurance against
even the danger of Thotmes and his
powers. There was no limit to the
weapon’s potentialities. The stronger
the charge, the more effective the results.
With a powerful enough charge,
Tony thought sardonically, he could
bring down the whole pyramid. Unfortunately
he had no ammunition,
save for the clip in the gun’s butt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a side passage he hesitated, realizing
that the new tunnel led up.
The priests would not expect him to
take this path—so he did so. And, as
it turned out, he was wise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came out on a little balcony overlooking
the sloping ramp of the pyramid.
Beneath him the massive piles of
masonry fled down like gigantic steps,
and Tony hesitated as he glanced down.
A noise from behind him, along the
passage, helped him make his decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was almost too late. A priest
burst into view, mouth open in a soundless
scream, raising a short metal rod
in one hand. Tony flung up the carbon-gun
and squeezed the trigger. Nothing
happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ammunition was exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s reaction was involuntary and
instinctive. He flung the gun straight
at the priest’s face and ducked, diving
in at his opponent. A beam of light
lanced out over Tony’s head. Then he
crashed into the priest’s knees and
brought the man down heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no time for ethics. Tony
struck low and hard. He left the priest
unconscious and vaulted the balcony’s
rail. Down the slope of the pyramid he
sprang, leaping along the huge steps
made by the giant blocks, risking his
neck at every jump. But—he made it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once at the base of the pyramid, he
was comparatively safe. Out of the red
glow the shadows were heavy, and Tony
took advantage of them to slink away
toward the wall of the cavern he could
see far ahead of him. But before he
did so he made a brief scouting trip,
hoping to find Phil. It was useless.
Either Phil had already made good his
escape, or else he had fallen victim to
the priests of Thotmes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no sign of excitement.
Tony wondered why. Perhaps the
escape of prisoners was of little importance
to the Atlanteans. They were too
self-confident—with good reason, it
might be. Science that could rip the
Earth asunder was not easily to be conquered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near the door of the Temple of Osiris
Tony quickened his pace. The sound
of hoarse breathing and shuffling footsteps
came to his ears. On the threshold
he hesitated, staring, but saw nothing
in the dimness of the interior. Wait!
Far down beneath the dais were two motionless
bodies. One was that of Captain
Brady, of course. But the other—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony broke into a run. Yet he retained
caution enough to move as silently
as possible, though he could hardly
repress a shouted question. Had the
Atlanteans found the intruders in Alu?
Was the body that of Desquer, or—Jimmy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was neither! Tony stumbled over
a carbon-gun, snatched it up in one motion,
and simultaneously saw that beside
the figure of Brady lay Phil, unconscious
and bloodstained, red fluid seeping
from a gaping hole in his chest. But
Tony could spare only one glance at his
brother. Beside him, between the pillars
that towered to the roof, two men
were locked in conflict—Jimmy and
Commander Desquer!</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy was getting the worst of it.
He was weaponless and trying to
hold on to the hand in which Desquer
held his gun. The commander was
slowly breaking his opponent’s grip.
No expression showed in the Legion officer’s
face, but his eyes were black and
deadly as wet velvet. Jimmy was gasping
and bleeding from a cut over one
eye, almost exhausted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony said, his voice like a whiplash,
“<span class='it'>Drop that gun, Desquer!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commander’s reaction was unexpected.
All in one swift motion he released
Jimmy and flung himself back.
Hidden in the shadow of the pillars, he
fired at Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shot missed. Tony lifted his
own weapon—the one Jimmy had apparently
dropped—but Desquer was
fleeing, dodging in and out like a phantom.
Why the devil—! Then Tony
knew why. Desquer was no coward.
But, on the other hand, he was no fool.
He had run out of ammunition. A cartridge
belt on the floor, its buckle torn
off, explained the reason. In the fight
Desquer had lost the belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He vanished through the door of the
temple and was gone. Tony stared at
Jimmy. “What the hell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy was white and gasping.
“Phil got back. He’d seen you in the
pyramid—told us where the machine
was. But he’d been wounded—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yeah. Keep talking, kid.” Tony
was kneeling beside the unconscious
form of Phil, rendering such first aid as
he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Desquer sent me outside to keep
guard. I heard Phil yell, and came running
in. I was just in time to see Desquer—”
The boy swallowed. “He
killed Phil, Tony. Shot him through
the chest. I tried to stop him—and
then you came in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil’s eyelashes flickered. Tony gave
Jimmy the gun. “Okay. Run along
and keep guard again. Watch out for
Desquer. If he shows up—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll use the gun.” There was deadly
grimness in the young voice. Jimmy’s
hand closed over the weapon; he hurried
off down the dark aisle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil was looking up at his brother, a
wry grin twisting his lips. “So you got
out of the pyramid too, eh? Good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened, boy?” Tony was
futilely trying to stanch the flow of
blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing much. Desquer didn’t
bandage me up after I got here. He
searched me, instead. Found nothing,
of course. But—he asked me where
the Earth Star was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a little silence. Tony
whispered, “How—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Desquer found out
something. He’s after the gem.
Thought I had it, and when he couldn’t
find it on me, he tried to make me talk.
His methods weren’t very—nice.
That’s when I yelled, I guess. I jumped
at Desquer. Found out I wasn’t as badly
wounded as I’d thought. He shot me
through the chest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phil coughed. “Might as well stop
trying, Tony. I’m the first of us to go.
I’ve a hunch there’ll be another. But
one of us three ought to pull through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get Desquer,” Tony said very
softly. His thin, dark face was a grim
mask of copper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. And keep an eye on the
kid, will you? I—I—” A gush of
blood came from Phil’s mouth. He
coughed rackingly. Tony hurriedly
ripped off his shirt to improvise an additional
bandage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it was useless. Ten minutes
later Tony stood silently beside the
body of his brother, looking down at the
stolid features, relaxed utterly now in
death. The shadows of the temple of
Osiris pressed in heavily. It was, in a
way, fitting that death should have
come for Phil in Alu, the asphodel land
where Egyptians thought the souls went
to roam endlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony turned and walked slowly along
the aisle. At the threshold of the temple
he turned and looked back. Phil
would rest there forever, perhaps—and
it was such a sarcophagus as few men
have ever possessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t move,” a low voice commanded.
“Not an inch! <span class='it'>Careful!</span>”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/img-3.jpg' alt='' />
<p class='caption'>“Don’t move! Not if you value your lives!”</p>
</div>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>But Tony’s reaction was involuntary
as he whirled. Almost beside him, but
out of easy reach, was Commander
Desquer. In his hand was a carbon-gun,
and another was in his holster. The
man’s glittering eyes watched Tony
icily from under the shaggy penthouse
brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Careful!” Desquer repeated. “Your
brother wasn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He isn’t hurt. He’ll
wake up in a few minutes. Just
stunned. My gun wasn’t loaded, but his
was. So—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer grinned and passed his palm
over his shaved scalp. “Revive him.
Quick!” he barked as Tony hesitated.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The latter silently went to where
Jimmy lay huddled against the wall
of the temple. He knelt beside the boy
and began to slap his cheeks. He
glanced up once to see the Commander
watching him narrowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer said, “Where’s the Earth Star?
You got it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what you’re talking
about,” Tony grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Then let me explain. That
televisor call that took me to the surface—it
was from a man named Zadah,
the secretary of a certain Rajah. He
told me all about you. Offered me a
fortune if I got the jewel back for him.
Well—I intend to. I’m sick of the
Legion, and this is my chance to buy
my way out and live like a prince. So—where’s
the stone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony told him, but his remark was
unprintable. Desquer’s thick lips twisted
in a sneer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. But I’ll get it, remember
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lot of good it’ll do you now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get out of here. But first we’re
going to destroy that machine of Thotmes.
Your brother’s waking up. Bring
him along. We’re heading for the pyramid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimly Tony hoisted the half-unconscious
Jimmy to his feet and supported
him. “We’re unarmed. There are
scores of priests—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to stay unarmed,”
Desquer snapped. “I can handle a gun
better than any three men. <span class='it'>Allons!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony grunted and started out, carrying
most of Jimmy’s weight on his
shoulders as the boy slowly recovered
from the blow that had stunned him.
His lips were a tight, pale line. Both he
and Jimmy were completely in Desquer’s
power, and the man was so completely
an egotist that he had not hesitated
to carry out his own plans even in
the face of a doom that threatened the
entire Earth. Ruthless Desquer was—but
of his icy courage there could be no
doubt. Nor of his greed! Tony sensed
something of the driving power within
the man, the desolate years of loneliness
in Sub-Sahara, a prison worse for
Desquer, perhaps, than for any other
man there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They moved toward the pyramid,
keeping to the shadows. Tony and
Jimmy preceded their captor, conscious
always of the gun leveled unerringly
at their backs. There was neither sign
nor movement to indicate the presence
of the Atlanteans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you expect to get to the
machine?” Tony asked finally. “It’s
guarded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can outshoot a dozen Copts,”
Desquer said confidently. “We’re going
straight in. We’ll find a guide—make
him guide us. If anyone gets in
our way, he’ll regret it. We’re going
in, smash the machine, and come out
again. And then—I’ll find out which
of you has the Earth Star.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony didn’t reply. He went on, his
mind desperately searching for a plan.
But it seemed hopeless. There was no
way out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally only a broad plaza separated
them from the pyramid. At its edge
the trio paused. Desquer said, “We’ll
skirt around to that building—see it?
It juts into the open space .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t
see any guards, but there may be some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three were standing in the
shadow at the corner of a tall stone
obelisk. And without warning a score
of figures dropped down upon them, in
utter silence—and with murderous
fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer’s guns were in his hands.
The snarling crackle of the carbon-pistols
rapped out, awakening echoes
in the dead city. Tony could not see
the commander; he was borne down
under a press of bodies, struggling furiously.
Beside him he heard Jimmy
cursing and striking out weakly. The
Atlantean priests were not using their
ray-projectors, perhaps because they
depended on weight of numbers. That
was their mistake!</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>It was Desquer’s fearless savagery
turned the tide of battle. His guns
bellowed without ceasing. Thrice he
went down, rising at last a gargoylish,
hideous figure, dripping with blood from
a dozen wounds, his bare scalp shining
blackly in the red light. One by one
and two by two he killed, mercilessly,
viciously, finally clubbing his pistol to
dispose of the last of the priests, who
was atop Tony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t waste ammunition,” he
growled. “Get up! Both of you!
Hurry!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony stood up, Jimmy beside him.
A few of the priests <span class='it'>had</span> escaped, he saw,
and were even now fleeing toward the
temple. Desquer raised his gun, hesitated,
and lowered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony stared. Scores—no, more than
a hundred priests were pouring from
the pyramid, forming a phalanx massing
itself to guard the threshold. In the
lead stood Thotmes, his spade beard
making him easily recognizable. The
fleeing priests joined their companions,
and the little army stood in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not using their ray-projectors,”
Tony said. “Guess they’re good only
at short range.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer snarled, “Come on!” His
guns snouted forward, urging his captives
on. Slowly they moved across the
plaza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commander fired. A priest fell,
screaming. The ranks closed in, hiding
him from view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again and again Desquer fired. His
gun clicked on an empty chamber; he
emptied the other one. Then he reached
for his belt—and Tony heard him curse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dieu!</span> Those damned Copts! The
priests—they got my ammunition belt
in the fight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony stopped, turned. Desquer was
standing straddle-legged, the carbon-pistols,
futile without coal, pointing at
the priests. His face was set into rock-hard
lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thotmes shouted something and
lifted the missing ammunition belt in
one hand. He raised it tauntingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got any coal?” Desquer rasped. The
other two men shook their heads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The priests began to move forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony said, “You can’t destroy the
machine now, Desquer. You’ve doomed
the world—and yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer’s knuckles were white; he
stood as though carven from granite.
His jet eyes squinted at the oncoming
mob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy started to laugh. “How do
you like it, Desquer?” he mocked.
“You’re not the commander now.
You’re just a guy with an empty gun.
And—you’re going to die, Desquer.
<span class='it'>You’re going to die!</span>”</p>

<div><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>The New Atlantis</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The tension grew unendurable. The
priests were advancing slowly, as
though assured that their quarry could
not escape. In the lead Thotmes was
smiling and stroking his beard with one
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surrender,” he called out. “No
harm will come to you—for a while.
Not till we need new beast-gods!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer’s face went a mottled red.
But still there was no fear in the man.
He faced the throng, still holding his
guns—and suddenly sheathed one and
began to search his pockets. His low
voice rapped out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick, you fools! See if there’s
anything on you we can use for ammunition.
It doesn’t have to be coal—carbon
will do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony shot one hurried glance at the
mob of priests. Desquer gave a little
cry of triumph and brought out a single
coal-cartridge from his tunic pocket.
“Good! Only one, but—” He slipped
it into the gun’s firing cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a queer look, almost of
amusement, on Tony’s dark face. He
gripped Jimmy’s arm and whispered,
“Wait!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer stepped forward. He raised
his gun and called, “Halt!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A flashing smile came from Thotmes.
The high priest did not reply. He kept
on.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Desquer fired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thotmes seemed surprised. He
paused, lifting his hands to a chest that
was a gory mass of red ruin. He stared
at his bloodstained fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the priests went up a whisper
of terror—as Thotmes fell! The high
priest of Alu was dead!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer did not pause. He took one
step forward, and another, as though
expecting his enemies to give back. But
they did not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They massed together grimly—and
advanced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time the commander paused, his
thick lips twisting. His hand dived into
his tunic pocket in a futile gesture. But
there was no more ammunition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony was smiling. He touched Desquer’s
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve a bullet for you, commander.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” The glittering eyes widened.
“Where—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer’s gaze focused on what Tony
held in his palm. Lens-shaped and
lovely the great gem lay there, flashing
in the red light of Alu. Like a diamond
it was—but it was not a diamond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy said breathlessly, “Tony!
You—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The Earth Star!</span>” There was sweat
on Desquer’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” Tony whispered. “Take it,
commander! It’s carbon. You can
use it as a bullet. A coal-cartridge will
kill a man. This jewel’s much harder
than stone. There’s no limit to the
power of a carbon gun. You can bring
down the pyramid with this—commander!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer still did not move, and Tony
deftly slipped the jewel into the gun’s
cup. It rested there in its strange setting,
beautiful beyond imagination,
holding within its fiery heart fortunes
and grandeur and death. A jewel—but
it was carbon, too. And Desquer’s eyes
did not move from the great gem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shoot,” Tony said. “If you do, you
lose the Earth Star. If you don’t—it
means death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commander’s face was shining
with sweat. He glanced up once to the
mob of priests, very close now. His
gross frame shook with the agony of
indecision. To possess the Earth Star—and
to know that its possession meant
certain doom! He had only to squeeze
the trigger, and his enemies would be
blasted out of existence. But if he did
that—</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would lose the Earth Star!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He snarled at Tony, “So you were the
one! The Merlin—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Fire!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost involuntarily Desquer brought
up the gun and aimed it. He was whispering
curses under his breath, putting
off until the last moment the decision
that must be made sooner or later. And
he dared not wait too long. The priests
came closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flickering red glow made Desquer’s
features scarlet and black; his
eyes burned balefully, tortured and terrible.
He said, “Damn you! I—I’ll—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His finger tightened on the trigger.
And—stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the priests had paused. They
were staring at the Earth Star. They,
too, were frozen motionless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One cried, “The jewel! The jewel!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tableau held. Abruptly the
priests gave back, hesitating. Tony
heard Jimmy’s gasp. He, too, was wondering
what this meant.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>He was never to know. Perhaps,
in long-forgotten ages, another
Earth Star had been dug out from beneath
the Atlantic, to form part of the
religion of Atlantis. Tony could not
know. But he realized that the priests
recognized the jewel, or thought they
did. They bowed before it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly Desquer realized his opportunity.
He said quietly, “Come on.
We’re going into the pyramid—and
smash the machine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony said, “You’re crazy. The
priests won’t stand for <span class='it'>that</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer grinned unpleasantly. Without
warning the other gun was in his
hand; he clubbed it and swung. Tony
felt a crashing blow on his head as he
ducked. Gasping with pain, he reeled
in and closed with the giant commander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy had hold of Desquer’s arm
but with one sweeping motion the officer
sent the boy sprawling. Desquer
and Tony went down with a crash on
the stones. Soft cries came from the
priests. They began to move forward
again, their superstitious terror gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer’s stubby fingers were sunk
into Tony’s throat; he squeezed viciously,
his tiny eyes glinting. Though
he lay undermost, he was getting the
better of the battle. Tony pumped
blow after blow at the commander’s
face, but apparently without effect. He
felt Jimmy at his side, saw the boy try
to tear the iron fingers from his brother’s
neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, too, Tony saw the carbon-pistol
lying on the stones near by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jimmy!” His voice was a cracked
wheeze. “Gun—pyramid—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into Desquer’s eyes sprang murder-light.
The fingers contracted, sending
agony down Tony’s spine. Jimmy understood,
though, and dived for the
pistol. He snatched it up, leveled it
at the pyramid and the oncoming
priests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Desquer yelled like a beast. His
fingers relaxed. Somehow he writhed
free, sprang up, plunged toward Jimmy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” he bellowed. “Don’t—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the gun’s muzzle burst a raving
blast of searing flame. The incredible
pressure that had made the Earth Star
was released. Straight through the
ranks of the priests it bored an aisle,
into the heart of the pyramid, melting
and wrecking solid stone with the terrific
power of its thrust. The volcanic
fires of Earth itself seemed to be latent
in that—bullet!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the cries of the priests came
a rumbling, crashing thunder. A block
fell, clattering down the pyramid’s side.
The structure buckled. Its whole side
was torn out. The summit toppled and
came thundering down, amid clouds
of smoking dust and ruin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony staggered erect, staring up.
Something was happening to the cavern
roof. The pyramid <span class='it'>had</span> been a pillar,
supporting it. And now the support
was gone—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rocks fell from above. Cracks ran
out like a great spider web. Something
silvery flashed down from above, glinting
red in the crimson glow. Tony remembered
that above Alu was—the
Midnight Sea!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And that sunless, tideless ocean was
pouring into the cavern world through
the crevasse that had been torn in its
floor!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The falling water became a column,
a torrent, a bellowing Niagara. It
drowned the wreckage of the pyramid.
Down the flood came thundering, and
icy tides lapped at Tony’s feet. He
seized Jimmy’s arm, pushed him along.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to get out of here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How—how can we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can try—”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Their voices, raised to shouts,
sounded like thin whispers above
the mighty rush of the ocean that was
pouring into Alu. The priests ran about
aimlessly, and among them, Tony saw,
was Commander Desquer. A knot of
the Atlanteans surrounded the officer.
They were trying to pull him down, like
wolves surrounding a bison. Unarmed,
Desquer yet was stronger than his opponents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently Jimmy pointed. Tony’s teeth
showed in a mirthless grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So what?” his lips formed. He was
remembering Phil .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brothers plunged along the
street, already knee deep in surging
black water. A louder thunder came
from behind them. A new sound filled
the cavern—a deep hissing, like steam.
Beyond the wreck of the pyramid, Tony
saw with a quick glance, crimson clouds
were lifting. So the red light of Alu
was actually due to volcanic activity.
And now the icy waters of the Midnight
Sea were finding the molten fires of
lava—</p>

<p class='pindent'>More rocks fell thunderously. Looking
back, Tony saw a single figure
charging after them—Desquer, a battered,
bleeding giant who splashed on
through the water amid a hail of stone
that dropped from the vaulted heaven
of Alu. All about him that deadly hail
dropped. One glance Tony had of Desquer
rushing on, heavy shoulders
hunched, teeth bared in a mirthless
grin—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he was gone! The avalanche
from the cracking skies buried him. A
pile of rocks showed for an instant
where he had been, and that, too, vanished
as the rising waters seethed past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony said nothing, but as he fought
past the temple of Osiris where Phil’s
body lay, he lifted his hand in a queer,
quick salute. Perhaps Phil would
know, now, that his death had been
avenged .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already the dark tides were seething
at the tunnel-mouth that led to the upper
world. On the threshold Tony
paused, to take one last look at ruined
Alu. The red light was darker now,
and somber. The flaming clouds boiled
up endlessly; the rock shook and
quaked underfoot. The Niagara that
poured from the roof of the cave
looked like a solid obelisk, and an odd
thought came into Tony’s mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pillar of cloud by day .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
a pillar of smoke by night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alu, daughter of Atlantis, was dying
as the mother continent had died.
Earth-fires and deluge were slaying
her, wiping out all life, wrecking the
culture that had survived from the
misty, unknown eons before Egypt
was. The huge temples, half submerged
in seething tides, were falling
in ruin. All over the vast cavern darkness
was falling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arched ramp they had seen on
entering Alu was still visible, far away.
And now Tony saw that there were
figures upon it, as there had been at
first. Figures with strange, misshapen
heads—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pitiable, terrible beast-gods of
Alu, created by dead Thotmes’ science!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One glimpse Tony had of those far
figures, outlined blackly against red
smoke. Then—the ramp fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over Alu the roaring desolation of
death and ruin held sway!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony turned to the white-faced Jimmy.
Already the water was tearing at
their thighs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” he shouted. “We’re getting
out of here. Fast!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fled up the tunnel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest was sheer nightmare.
Somehow they found their way, following
always the passages that led up,
hiding from terrified, frantic Copts,
fleeing through corridors whose walls
shook with the grip of earthquake. Up
and up they went, finding at last a
frightened Copt who agreed to guide
them to the surface. His own world
was falling in pieces about him, and he
wished only to escape. A cave-in
crushed him not long after, but the
passage stretched unbroken before the
brothers. They toiled on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Daylight filtered in yellow brilliance
through a crack in the rock. Exhausted,
haggard, filthy scarecrows, the
two squeezed through into blazing
sunlight. About them lay rolling
dunes. They were in a rocky little
valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They dropped to the sand and lay
there motionless for hours, scarcely
conscious of the burning sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soft mutter of a gyro motor
woke them. Tony sat up, blinking. He
was in time to see a plane land softly
not far away, and a figure in flying uniform
step out.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>Jimmy was still sleeping. Tony
lurched forward to greet the new
arrival. His eyes were misty with
sleep, and he did not at first recognize
the pilot—not till the latter took out
an automatic and held it ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he saw it was Zadah, the
Rajah’s secretary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony stopped, swaying a little, his
arms hanging limp at his sides. Zadah’s
round face was triumphant. The
beady eyes shone with triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Luck,” he said. “I’ve been cruising
about for hours just on an off chance.
I just happened to sight you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Copts.” Tony said thickly.
“They—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zadah nodded. “I know. Your
legionnaire got through—Jacklyn.
There’s an army of troopers at the
mouth of Sub-Sahara. But—where’s
the Earth Star? If you escaped, that
means Desquer didn’t get it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s gone. Desquer got it—and
used it. The Earth Star’s destroyed,
Zadah.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other hesitated. Something he
saw in Tony’s eyes made him realize
that the latter spoke truth. Abruptly
baffled rage sprang into Zadah’s round
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone! Then—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted the gun, his lips white with
fury at the wreckage of his plans.
“Maybe! If you’re lying, I’ll find the
jewel on your bodies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony tensed himself for a spring that
he knew in advance would be futile.
But, before he could move, another
figure hurled itself forward. Jimmy’s
slight frame dived at the killer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zadah’s gun barked. Jimmy cried
out; the Oriental swung his weapon
back to Tony. But he was too late.
His wrist was held in a grip of iron.
Tony’s dark face was close to his own,
and there was death in the somber
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Zadah screamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony said not a word. Very slowly,
very carefully, he bent Zadah’s hand
back. The latter’s finger was still on
the trigger. The gun pointed at last
at the killer’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Tony smiled—and the muscles
of his hand contracted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report was shatteringly loud in
the desert stillness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony let the limp body slide down,
and turned back to Jimmy. The boy
was dead. Zadah’s bullet had made a
neat little hole in the brown shirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment Tony carried the
body of his brother to the plane and
put it aboard. He followed. He sent
the gyro winging up over the desert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath him the Sahara stretched, a
white wilderness under the flaming heat
of the Sun. To the north could be seen
an encampment, the troopers that had
arrived, too late, at the mouth of Sub-Sahara.
Tony set the controls and fled
beyond them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The desert gave place to the Mediterranean,
and that, in turn, to the Pacific
Ocean. The cool blueness of
night folded down. Moonlight silvered
the waves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony opened a trap-door in the floor
and let the body of his brother slide
through. Phil rested in the temple of
Osiris—and Jimmy would lie beneath
the waves that hid Atlantis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went back to the controls, staring
ahead at an empty horizon. Westward
lay New York. He could go back there
now; the motive for keeping hidden
had vanished. No one would know
who the Merlin was. Some men might
guess, might be convinced that either
Phil or Jimmy had stolen the Earth Star—but
they would never dare make
an accusation, and Seth Martell would
need make no compromises with his
honor and his ideals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only Tony would know that the
Merlin had been his brother Phil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For ten minutes he had been alone
with Phil in the Temple of Osiris. And,
before the youth died, he had told Tony
the truth—that he was the Merlin.
He had given his brother the Earth Star
to keep. But no one would ever
know that now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tony’s throat was tight. He stared
at the dim horizon of sky and sea,
knowing that beyond it lay New York,
and a life he could take up again
where he had left it. A life he must
live—alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint glow brightened to the west.
The tallest towers of Manhattan were
pillars of light against the sky.</p>
